[[chapter_10_external_events]]
== Event-Driven Architecture: Using Events to Integrate Microservices

In the last chapter we never actually spoke about _how_ we would receive
the "batch quantity changed" events, or indeed, how we might notify the
outside world about reallocations.

We've got a microservice with a web API, but what about other ways of talking
to other systems?  How does it know if, say, a shipment is delayed or the
quantity is amended?  How does it communicate to our warehouse system to say
that an order has been allocated and needs to be sent to a customer?

In this chapter we'd like to show how the events metaphor can be extended
to encompass the way that we handle incoming and outgoing messages from the
system. Internally, the core of our application is now a message processor.
Let follow through on that so it becomes a message processor _externally_ as
well.  The application can receive events from external sources, via an
external message bus (we'll use Redis pubsub queues as an example), and publish
its outputs, in the form of events, back there as well.

=== Using a Redis Pubsub Channel for Integration

To avoid the "distributed BBOM" antipattern, instead of temporally coupled HTTP
API calls, we want to use some sort of asynchronous messaging layer to
integrate between systems.  We want our "batch quantity changed" messages to
come in as external events from upstream systems, and we want our system to
publish "allocated" events for downstream systems to listen to.

When moving towards events as an integration solution, you need to choose
some sort of technology for passing those events from one system to another.
We need to be able to publish events to some central service, and we need some
way for other systems to be able to "subscribe" to different types of messages,
and pick them up asynchronously from some sort of queue.

At MADE.com we use https://eventstore.org/[Eventstore];  Kafka or RabbitMQ
are valid alternatives. A lightweight solution based on Redis
https://redis.io/topics/pubsub[pubsub channels] can also work just fine, and since
Redis is much more generally familiar to people, we thought we'd use it for this
book.

NOTE: We're glossing over the complexity involved in choosing the right messaging
    platform.  Concerns like message ordering, failure handling and idempotency
    all need to be thought through.  For a few pointers, see the
    <<footguns,Footguns>> section in <<epilogue_1_how_to_get_there_from_here>>.

Our new flow will look like this:

    MessageBus -> Domain_Model : allocate
    Domain_Model -> MessageBus : emit Allocated event(s)
end

=== Test-Driving It All Using an End-To-End Test

Here's how we might start with an end-to-end test.  We can use our existing
API to create batches, and then we'll test both inbound and outbound messages:


[[redis_e2e_test]]
.An end-to-end test for our pubsub model (tests/e2e/test_external_events.py)
====
[source,python]
----
def test_change_batch_quantity_leading_to_reallocation():
    # start with two batches and an order allocated to one of them  #<1>
    orderid, sku = random_orderid(), random_sku()
    earlier_batch, later_batch = random_batchref('old'), random_batchref('newer')
    api_client.post_to_add_batch(earlier_batch, sku, qty=10, eta='2011-01-02')  #<2>
    api_client.post_to_add_batch(later_batch, sku, qty=10, eta='2011-01-02')  #<2>
    response = api_client.post_to_allocate(orderid, sku, 10)  #<2>
    assert response.json()['batchref'] == earlier_batch

    subscription = redis_client.subscribe_to('line_allocated')  #<3>

    # change quantity on allocated batch so it's less than our order  #<1>
    redis_client.publish_message('change_batch_quantity', {  #<3>
        'batchref': earlier_batch, 'qty': 5
    })

    # wait until we see a message saying the order has been reallocated  #<1>
    messages = []
    for attempt in Retrying(stop=stop_after_delay(3), reraise=True):  #<4>
        with attempt:
            message = subscription.get_message(timeout=1)
            if message:
                messages.append(message)
                print(messages)
            data = json.loads(messages[-1]['data'])
            assert data['orderid'] == orderid
            assert data['batchref'] == later_batch
----
====

<1> You can read the story of what's going on in this test from the comments:
    we want to send an event into the system that causes an order line to be
    reallocated, and we see that reallocation come out as an event in redis too.

<2> `api_client` is a little helper that we refactored out to share between
    our two test types, it wraps our calls to `requests.post`

<3> `redis_client` is another test little test helper, the details of which
    don't really matter; its job is to be able to send and receive messages
    from various Redis channels. We'll use a channel called
    `change_batch_quantity` to send in our request to change the quantity for a
    batch, and we'll listen to another channel called `line_allocated` to
    look out for the expected reallocation.

<4> Because of the asynchronous nature of the system under test, we need to use
    the `tenacity` library again to add a retry loop.  Firstly because it may
    take some time for our new `line_allocated` message to arrive, but also
    because it won't be the only message on that channel.

////
TODO (ej) Minor comment: This e2e test might not be safe or repeatable as part of a
     larger test suite, since test run data is being persisted in redis.
     Purging the queue as part of setup will help, but it would still have problems
     with running tests in parallel. Not sure if it's worth bringing up as it might
     be too much of a digression.

==== Redis Is Another Thin Adapter Around Our Message Bus

Our Redis pubsub client is very much like flask:  it translates from the outside
world to our events:


[[redis_pubsub_first_cut]]
.A first cut of a redis message listener (src/allocation/redis_pubsub.py)
====
[source,python]
----
r = redis.Redis(**config.get_redis_host_and_port())


def main():
    orm.start_mappers()
    pubsub = r.pubsub(ignore_subscribe_messages=True)
    pubsub.subscribe('change_batch_quantity')  #<1>

    for m in pubsub.listen():
        handle_change_batch_quantity(m)


def handle_change_batch_quantity(m):
    logging.debug('handling %s', m)
    data = json.loads(m['data'])  #<2>
    cmd = commands.ChangeBatchQuantity(ref=data['batchref'], qty=data['qty'])  #<2>
    messagebus.handle(cmd, uow=unit_of_work.SqlAlchemyUnitOfWork())


def publish(channel, event: events.Event):  #<3>
    logging.debug('publishing: channel=%s, event=%s', channel, event)
    r.publish(channel, json.dumps(asdict(event)))
----
====

<1> `main()` subscribes us to the `change_batch_quantity` channel on load

<2> And our main job as an entrypoint to the system is to deserialize JSON,
    convert it to a `Command`, and pass it to the service layer--much like the
    Flask adapter does.

<3> We also provide a helper function to publish events back into Redis.


==== Our New Outgoing Event

Here's what the `Allocated` event will look like:

[[allocated_event]]
.New event (src/allocation/events.py)
====
[source,python]
----
@dataclass
class Allocated(Event):
    orderid: str
    sku: str
    qty: int
    batchref: str
----
====

It captures everything we need to know about an allocation: the details of the
order line, and which batch it was allocated to.


We use add it into our model's `allocate()` method (having added a test
first, naturally)

[[model_emits_allocated_event]]
.Product.allocate() emits new event to record what happened (src/allocation/model.py)
====
[source,python]
----
class Product:
    ...
    def allocate(self, line: OrderLine) -> str:
        ...

            batch.allocate(line)
            self.version_number += 1
            self.events.append(events.Allocated(
                orderid=line.orderid, sku=line.sku, qty=line.qty,
                batchref=batch.reference,
            ))
            return batch.reference
----
====


The handler for `ChangeBatchQuantity` already exists, so all we need to add
is a handler that publishes the outgoing event:


[[another_handler]]
.The messagebus grows (src/allocation/messagebus.py)
====
[source,python,highlight=2]
----
HANDLERS = {
    events.Allocated: [handlers.publish_allocated_event],
    events.OutOfStock: [handlers.send_out_of_stock_notification],
}  # type: Dict[Type[events.Event], List[Callable]]
----
====

Publishing the event uses our helper function from the Redis wrapper:

[[publish_event_handler]]
.Publish to redis (src/allocation/handlers.py)
====
[source,python]
----
def publish_allocated_event(
        event: events.Allocated, uow: unit_of_work.AbstractUnitOfWork,
):
    redis_pubsub.publish('line_allocated', event)
----
====


TIP: Outbound events are one of the places it's important to apply some validation.
    See <<appendix_validation>> for some validation philosophy and examples.



.Internal vs External events
*******************************************************************************
It's a good idea to keep the distinction between internal and external events
clear.  Some events may come from the outside, and some events may get upgraded
and published externally, but not all of them.  This is particularly important
if you get into [event sourcing](https://io.made.com/eventsourcing-101/) (very
much a topic for another book though).

*******************************************************************************

// TODO (EJ) Some discussion of idempotency and at-most-once, vs at-least-once
// delivery might be good.

=== Wrap-Up

* events can come _from_ the outside, but they can also be published
  externally -- our `publish` handler converts an event to a message
  on a Redis channel. We use events to talk to the outside world.

[quote, Martin Fowler, https://martinfowler.com/articles/201701-event-driven.html[What do you mean by “Event-Driven”?]]
____
Event notification is nice because it implies a low level of coupling, and is
pretty simple to set up. It can become problematic, however, if there is
a logical flow that runs over various event notifications. [...] It can be hard to
see as it's not explicit in any program text; this can make it hard to debug
and modify.
