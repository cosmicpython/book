== Command-Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)

((("command-query responsibility segregation (CQRS)", id="ix_CQRS")))
((("CQRS", see="command-query responsibility segregation")))
((("queries", seealso="command-query responsibility segregation")))
In this chapter, we're going to start with a fairly uncontroversial insight:
reads (queries) and writes (commands) are different, so they
should be treated differently (or have their responsibilities segregated, if you will). Then we're going to push that insight as far
as we can. 

If you're anything like Harry, this will all seem extreme at first,
but hopefully we can make the argument that it's not _totally_ unreasonable.

<<maps_chapter_11>> shows where we might end up.

=== Domain Models Are for Writing

((("domain model", "writing data")))
((("command-query responsibility segregation (CQRS)", "domain models for writing")))
We've spent a lot of time in this book talking about how to build software that
enforces the rules of our domain. These rules, or constraints, will be different
for every application, and they make up the interesting core of our systems.

In this book, we've set explicit constraints like "You can't allocate more stock
than is available," as well as implicit constraints like "Each order line is
allocated to a single batch."

We wrote down these rules as unit tests at the beginning of the book:

[role="pagebreak-before"]
[[domain_tests]]
.Our basic domain tests (tests/unit/test_batches.py)
====
[source,python]
----
def test_allocating_to_a_batch_reduces_the_available_quantity():
    batch = Batch("batch-001", "SMALL-TABLE", qty=20, eta=date.today())
    line = OrderLine('order-ref', "SMALL-TABLE", 2)

    batch.allocate(line)

    assert batch.available_quantity == 18

...

def test_cannot_allocate_if_available_smaller_than_required():
    small_batch, large_line = make_batch_and_line("ELEGANT-LAMP", 2, 20)
    assert small_batch.can_allocate(large_line) is False
----
====

To apply these rules properly, we needed to ensure that operations
were consistent, and so we introduced patterns like _Unit of Work_ and _Aggregate_
that help us commit small chunks of work.

To communicate changes between those small chunks, we introduced the Domain Events pattern
so we can write rules like "When stock is damaged or lost, adjust the
available quantity on the batch, and reallocate orders if necessary."

All of this complexity exists so we can enforce rules when we change the
state of our system. We've built a flexible set of tools for writing data.

What about reads, though?

=== Most Users Aren't Going to Buy Your Furniture

((("command-query responsibility segregation (CQRS)", "reads")))
At MADE.com, we have a system very like the allocation service. In a busy day, we
might process one hundred orders in an hour, and we have a big gnarly system for
allocating stock to those orders.

In that same busy day, though, we might have one hundred product views per _second_.
Each time somebody visits a product page, or a product listing page, we need
to figure out whether the product is still in stock and how long it will take
us to deliver it.

((("eventually consistent reads")))
((("consistency", "eventually consistent reads")))
The _domain_ is the same--we're concerned with batches of stock, and their
arrival date, and the amount that's still available--but the access pattern
is very different. For example, our customers won't notice if the query
is a few seconds out of date, but if our allocate service is inconsistent,
we'll make a mess of their orders. We can take advantage of this difference by
making our reads _eventually consistent_ in order to make them perform better.

[role="nobreakinside less_space"]
.Is Read Consistency Truly Attainable?
*******************************************************************************

((("command-query responsibility segregation (CQRS)", "reads", "consistency of")))
((("consistency", "attainment of read consistency")))
This idea of trading consistency against performance makes a lot of developers
pass:[<span class="keep-together">nervous</span>] at first, so let's talk quickly about that.

Let's imagine that our "Get Available Stock" query is 30 seconds out of date
when Bob visits the page for `ASYMMETRICAL-DRESSER`.
Meanwhile, though, Harry has already bought the last item. When we try to
allocate Bob's order, we'll get a failure, and we'll need to either cancel his
order or buy more stock and delay his delivery.

People who've worked only with relational data stores get _really_ nervous
about this problem, but it's worth considering two other scenarios to gain some
perspective.

First, let's imagine that Bob and Harry both visit the page at _the same
time_. Harry goes off to make coffee, and by the time he returns, Bob has
already bought the last dresser. When Harry places his order, we send it to
the allocation service, and because there's not enough stock, we have to refund
his payment or buy more stock and delay his delivery.

As soon as we render the product page, the data is already stale. This insight
is key to understanding why reads can be safely inconsistent: we'll always need
to check the current state of our system when we come to allocate, because all
distributed systems are inconsistent. As soon as you have a web server and two
customers, you have the potential for stale data.

OK, let's assume we solve that problem somehow: we magically build a totally
consistent web application where nobody ever sees stale data. This time Harry
gets to the page first and buys his dresser.

Unfortunately for him, when the warehouse staff tries to dispatch his furniture,
it falls off the forklift and smashes into a zillion pieces. Now what?

The only options are to either call Harry and refund his order or buy more
stock and delay delivery.

No matter what we do, we're always going to find that our software systems are
inconsistent with reality, and so we'll always need business processes to cope
with these edge cases. It's OK to trade performance for consistency on the
read side, because stale data is essentially unavoidable.
*******************************************************************************

((("command-query responsibility segregation (CQRS)", "read side and write side")))
We can think of these requirements as forming two halves of a system:
the read side and the write side, shown in <<read_and_write_table>>.

For the write side, our fancy domain architectural patterns help us to evolve
our system over time, but the complexity we've built so far doesn't buy
anything for reading data. The service layer, the unit of work,  and the clever
domain model are just bloat.

=== Post/Redirect/Get and CQS

((("Post/Redirect/Get pattern")))
((("Post/Redirect/Get pattern", "command-query separation (CQS)")))
((("CQS (command-query separation)")))
((("command-query responsibility segregation (CQRS)", "Post/Redirect/Get pattern and CQS")))
If you do web development, you're probably familiar with the
Post/Redirect/Get pattern. In this technique, a web endpoint accepts an
HTTP POST and responds with a redirect to see the result. For example, we might
accept a POST to _/batches_ to create a new batch and redirect the user to
_/batches/123_ to see their newly created batch.

This approach fixes the problems that arise when users refresh the results page
in their browser or try to bookmark a results page. In the case of a refresh,
it can lead to our users double-submitting data and thus buying two sofas when they
needed only one. In the case of a bookmark, our hapless customers will end up
with a broken page when they try to GET a POST endpoint.

Both these problems happen because we're returning data in response to a write
operation. Post/Redirect/Get sidesteps the issue by separating the read and
write phases of our operation.

This technique is a simple example of command-query separation (CQS). In CQS we
follow one simple rule: functions should either modify state or answer
questions, but never both. This makes software easier to reason about: we should
always be able to ask, "Are the lights on?" without flicking the light switch.

NOTE: When building APIs, we can apply the same design technique by returning a
    201 Created, or a 202 Accepted, with a Location header containing the URI
    of our new resources. What's important here isn't the status code we use
    but the logical separation of work into a write phase and a query phase.

As you'll see, we can use the CQS principle to make our systems faster and more
scalable, but first, let's fix the CQS violation in our existing code. Ages ago, we introduced an `allocate` endpoint that takes an order and
calls our service layer to allocate some stock. At the end of the call, we
return a 200 OK and the batch ID. That's led to some ugly design flaws so that
we can get the data we need. Let's change it to return a simple OK message and
instead provide a new read-only endpoint to retrieve allocation state:

=== Hold On to Your Lunch, Folks

((("SQL", "raw SQL in views")))

((("command-query responsibility segregation (CQRS)", "building read-only views into our data")))
Hmm, so we can probably just add a list method to our existing repository
object:

            'SELECT ol.sku, b.reference'
            ' FROM allocations AS a'
            ' JOIN batches AS b ON a.batch_id = b.id'
            ' JOIN order_lines AS ol ON a.orderline_id = ol.id'
            ' WHERE ol.orderid = :orderid',
            dict(orderid=orderid)
        ))
    return [{'sku': sku, 'batchref': batchref} for sku, batchref in results]
----

_Excuse me?  Raw SQL?_

If you're anything like Harry encountering this pattern for the first time,
you'll be wondering what on earth Bob has been smoking. We're hand-rolling our
own SQL now, and converting database rows directly to dicts? After all the
effort we put into building a nice domain model? And what about the Repository
pattern? Isn't that meant to be our abstraction around the database? Why don't
we reuse that?

Well, let's explore that seemingly simpler alternative first, and see what it
looks like in practice.


We'll still keep our view in a separate _views.py_ module; enforcing a clear
distinction between reads and writes in your application is still a good idea.
We apply command-query separation, and it's easy to see which code modifies
state (the event handlers) and which code just retrieves read-only state (the views).

TIP: Splitting out your read-only views from your state-modifying
    command and event handlers is probably a good idea, even if you
    don't want to go to full-blown CQRS.


=== Testing CQRS Views

((("views", "testing CQRS views")))
((("testing", "integration test for CQRS view")))
((("command-query responsibility segregation (CQRS)", "testing views")))
Before we get into exploring various options, let's talk about testing.
Whichever approaches you decide to go for, you're probably going to need
at least one integration test.  Something like this:


[[integration_testing_views]]
.An integration test for a view (tests/integration/test_views.py)
====
[source,python]
----
def test_allocations_view(sqlite_session_factory):
    uow = unit_of_work.SqlAlchemyUnitOfWork(sqlite_session_factory)
    messagebus.handle(commands.CreateBatch('sku1batch', 'sku1', 50, None), uow)  #<1>
    messagebus.handle(commands.CreateBatch('sku2batch', 'sku2', 50, today), uow)
    messagebus.handle(commands.Allocate('order1', 'sku1', 20), uow)
    messagebus.handle(commands.Allocate('order1', 'sku2', 20), uow)
    # add a spurious batch and order to make sure we're getting the right ones
    messagebus.handle(commands.CreateBatch('sku1batch-later', 'sku1', 50, today), uow)
    messagebus.handle(commands.Allocate('otherorder', 'sku1', 30), uow)
    messagebus.handle(commands.Allocate('otherorder', 'sku2', 10), uow)

    assert views.allocations('order1', uow) == [
        {'sku': 'sku1', 'batchref': 'sku1batch'},
        {'sku': 'sku2', 'batchref': 'sku2batch'},
    ]
----
====

<1> We do the setup for the integration test by using the public entrypoint to
    our application, the message bus. That keeps our tests decoupled from
    any implementation/infrastructure details about how things get stored.

////
IDEA: sidebar on testing views.  some old content follows.

Before you dismiss the need to use integration tests as just another
anti-feather in the anti-cap of this total anti-pattern, it's worth thinking
through the alternatives.

- If you're going via the `Products` repository, then you'll need integration
  tests for any new query methods you add.

- If you're going via the ORM, you'll still need integration tests

- And if you decide to build a read-only `BatchRepository`, ignoring
  the purists that tell you you're not allowed to have a Repository for
  a non-Aggregate model class, call it `BatchDAL` if you want, in any case,
  you'll still need integration tests for _that_.

So the choice is about whether or not you want a layer of abstraction between
your permanent storage and the logic of your read-only views.

* If the views are relatively simple (all the logic in our case is in filtering
  down to the right batch references), then adding another layer doesn't seem
  worth it.

* If your views do more complex calculations, or need to invoke some business
  rules to decide what to display... If, in short, you find yourself writing a
  lot of integration tests for a single view, then it may be worth building
  that intermediary layer, so that you can test the SQL and the
  display/calculation/view logic separately

IDEA: some example code showing a DAL layer in front of some read-only view
code with more complex business logic.

=== "Obvious" Alternative 1: Using the Existing Repository

((("views", "simple view that uses the repository")))
((("command-query responsibility segregation (CQRS)", "simple view using existing repository")))
((("repositories", "simple view using existing repository")))
How about adding a helper method to our `products` repository?


[[view_using_repo]]
.A simple view that uses the repository (src/allocation/views.py)
====
[source,python]
[role="skip"]
----
from allocation import unit_of_work

def allocations(orderid: str, uow: unit_of_work.AbstractUnitOfWork):
    with uow:
        products = uow.products.for_order(orderid=orderid)  #<1>
        batches = [b for p in products for b in p.batches]  #<2>
        return [
            {'sku': b.sku, 'batchref': b.reference}
            for b in batches
            if orderid in b.orderids  #<3>
        ]
----
====

<1> Our repository returns `Product` objects, and we need to find all the
    products for the SKUs in a given order, so we'll build a new helper method
    called `.for_order()` on the repository.

<2> Now we have products but we actually want batch references, so we
    get all the possible batches with a list comprehension.

<3> We filter _again_ to get just the batches for our specific
    order. That, in turn, relies on our `Batch` objects being able to tell us
    which order IDs it has allocated.

We implement that last using a `.orderid` property:


[[orderids_on_batch]]
.An arguably unnecessary property on our model (src/allocation/domain/model.py)
====
[source,python]
[role="skip"]
----
class Batch:
    ...

    @property
    def orderids(self):
        return {l.orderid for l in self._allocations}
----
====

You can start to see that reusing our existing repository and domain model classes
is not as straightforward as you might have assumed.  We've had to add new helper
methods to both, and we're doing a bunch of looping and filtering in Python, which
is work that would be done much more efficiently by the database.

So yes, on the plus side we're reusing our existing abstractions, but on the
downside, it all feels quite clunky.


=== Your Domain Model Is Not Optimized for Read Operations

((("domain model", "not optimized for read operations")))
((("command-query responsibility segregation (CQRS)", "domain model not optimized for read operations")))
What we're seeing here are the effects of having a domain model that
is designed primarily for write operations, while our requirements for
reads are often conceptually quite different.

This is the chin-stroking-architect's justification for CQRS.  As we've said before,
a domain model is not a data model--we're trying to capture the way the
business works: workflow, rules around state changes, messages exchanged;
concerns about how the system reacts to external events and user input.
_Most of this stuff is totally irrelevant for read-only operations_.

TIP: This justification for CQRS is related to the justification for the Domain
    Model pattern. If you're building a simple CRUD app, reads and writes are
    going to be closely related, so you don't need a domain model or CQRS. But
    the more complex your domain, the more likely you are to need both.

To make a facile point, your domain classes will have multiple methods for
modifying state, and you won't need any of them for read-only operations.

As the complexity of your domain model grows, you will find yourself making
more and more choices about how to structure that model, which make it more and
more awkward to use for read operations.


===  "Obvious" Alternative 2: Using the ORM

((("command-query responsibility segregation (CQRS)", "view that uses the ORM")))
((("views", "simple view that uses the ORM")))
((("object-relational mappers (ORMs)", "simple view using the ORM")))
You may be thinking, OK, if our repository is clunky, and working with
`Products` is clunky, then I can at least  use my ORM and work with `Batches`.
That's what it's for!

            model.OrderLine, model.Batch._allocations

        )
        return [
            {'sku': b.sku, 'batchref': b.batchref}
            for b in batches
        ]
----
====

But is that _actually_ any easier to write or understand than the raw SQL
version from the code example in <<hold-on-ch12>>? It may not look too bad up there, but we
can tell you it took several attempts, and plenty of digging through the
SQLAlchemy docs. SQL is just SQL.

////
IDEA (hynek)
this seems like a PERFECT opportunity to talk about SQLAlchemy Core API. If you
have questions, pls talk to me. But jumping from ORM directly to raw SQL is
baby/bathwater.
////

But the ORM can also expose us to performance problems.


=== SELECT N+1 and Other Performance Considerations


((("SELECT N+1")))
((("object-relational mappers (ORMs)", "SELECT N+1 performance problem")))
((("command-query responsibility segregation (CQRS)", "SELECT N+1 and other performance problems")))
The so-called https://oreil.ly/OkBOS[`SELECT N+1`]
problem is a common performance problem with ORMs: when retrieving a list of
objects, your ORM will often perform an initial query to, say, get all the IDs
of the objects it needs, and then issue individual queries for each object to
retrieve their attributes. This is especially likely if there are any foreign-key relationships on your objects.

NOTE: In all fairness, we should say that SQLAlchemy is quite good at avoiding
    the `SELECT N+1` problem. It doesn't display it in the preceding example, and
    you can request https://oreil.ly/XKDDm[eager loading]
    explicitly to avoid it when dealing with joined objects.
    ((("eager loading")))
    ((("SQLAlchemy", "SELECT N+1 problem and")))

Beyond `SELECT N+1`, you may have other reasons for wanting to decouple the
way you persist state changes from the way that you retrieve current state.
A set of fully normalized relational tables is a good way to make sure that
write operations never cause data corruption. But retrieving data using lots
of joins can be slow. It's common in such cases to add some denormalized views,
build read replicas, or even add caching layers.


=== Time to Completely Jump the Shark

((("views", "keeping totally separate, denormalized datastore for view model")))
((("command-query responsibility segregation (CQRS)", "denormalized copy of your data optimized for read operations")))
On that note: have we convinced you that our raw SQL version isn't so weird as
it first seemed? Perhaps we were exaggerating for effect? Just you wait.

So, reasonable or not, that hardcoded SQL query is pretty ugly, right? What if
we made it nicer...

OK, nicer-looking SQL queries wouldn't be a justification for anything really,
but building a denormalized copy of your data that's optimized for read operations
isn't uncommon, once you've reached the limits of what you can do with indexes.

Even with well-tuned indexes, a relational database uses a lot of CPU to perform
joins. The fastest queries will always be pass:[<code>SELECT * from <em>mytable</em> WHERE <em>key</em> = :<em>value</em></code>].

((("SELECT * FROM WHERE queries")))
More than raw speed, though, this approach buys us scale. When we're writing
data to a relational database, we need to make sure that we get a lock over the
rows we're changing so we don't run into consistency problems.

If multiple clients are changing data at the same time, we'll have weird race
conditions. When we're _reading_ data, though, there's no limit to the number
of clients that can concurrently execute. For this reason, read-only stores can
be horizontally scaled out.

TIP: Because read replicas can be inconsistent, there's no limit to how many we
    can have. If you're struggling to scale a system with a complex data store,
    ask whether you could build a simpler read model.

((("views", "updating read model table using event handler")))
((("command-query responsibility segregation (CQRS)", "updating read model table using event handler")))
((("event handlers", "updating read model table using")))
Keeping the read model up to date is the challenge!  Database views
(materialized or otherwise) and triggers are a common solution, but that limits
you to your database. We'd like to show you how to reuse our event-driven
architecture instead.


==== Updating a Read Model Table Using an Event Handler

Here's what our update-view-model code looks like:

            'INSERT INTO allocations_view (orderid, sku, batchref)'
            ' VALUES (:orderid, :sku, :batchref)',
            dict(orderid=event.orderid, sku=event.sku, batchref=event.batchref)
        )
        uow.commit()

Believe it or not, that will pretty much work!  _And it will work
against the exact same integration tests as the rest of our options._

OK, you'll also need to handle `Deallocated`:

.A second listener for read model updates

[source,python]
[role="skip"]

events.Deallocated: [
    handlers.remove_allocation_from_read_model,
    handlers.reallocate
],

...

def remove_allocation_from_read_model(
        event: events.Deallocated, uow: unit_of_work.SqlAlchemyUnitOfWork,
):
    with uow:
        uow.session.execute(
            'DELETE FROM allocations_view '
            ' WHERE orderid = :orderid AND sku = :sku',

In <<read_model_sequence_diagram>>, you can see two
transactions in the POST/write operation, one to update the write model and one
to update the read model, which the GET/read operation can use.

.Rebuilding from Scratch
*******************************************************************************

((("command-query responsibility segregation (CQRS)", "rebuilding view model from scratch")))
((("views", "rebuilding view model from scratch")))
"What happens when it breaks?" should be the first question we ask as engineers.

How do we deal with a view model that hasn't been updated because of a bug or
temporary outage? Well, this is just another case where events and commands can
fail independently.

If we _never_ updated the view model, and the `ASYMMETRICAL-DRESSER` was forever in
stock, that would be annoying for customers, but the `allocate` service would
still fail, and we'd take action to fix the problem.

Rebuilding a view model is easy, though. Since we're using a service layer to
update our view model, we can write a tool that does the following:

* Queries the current state of the write side to work out what's currently
  allocated
* Calls the `add_allocate_to_read_model` handler for each allocated item

We can use this technique to create entirely new read models from historical
data.
*******************************************************************************

=== Changing Our Read Model Implementation Is Easy

((("command-query responsibility segregation (CQRS)", "changing read model implementation to use Redis")))
((("Redis, changing read model implementation to use")))
Let's see the flexibility that our event-driven model buys us in action,
by seeing what happens if we ever decide we want to implement a read model by
using a totally separate storage engine, Redis.

Just watch:


[[redis_readmodel_handlers]]
.Handlers update a Redis read model (src/allocation/service_layer/handlers.py)
====
[source,python]
[role="non-head"]
----
def add_allocation_to_read_model(event: events.Allocated, _):
    redis_eventpublisher.update_readmodel(event.orderid, event.sku, event.batchref)

def remove_allocation_from_read_model(event: events.Deallocated, _):
    redis_eventpublisher.update_readmodel(event.orderid, event.sku, None)
----
====

The helpers in our Redis module are one-liners:


[[redis_readmodel_client]]
.Redis read model read and update (src/allocation/adapters/redis_eventpublisher.py)
====
[source,python]
[role="non-head"]
----
def update_readmodel(orderid, sku, batchref):
    r.hset(orderid, sku, batchref)


def get_readmodel(orderid):
    return r.hgetall(orderid)
----
====

(Maybe the name __redis_eventpublisher.py__ is a misnomer now, but you get the idea.)

And the view itself changes very slightly to adapt to its new backend:

[[redis_readmodel_view]]
.View adapted to Redis (src/allocation/views.py)
====
[source,python]
[role="non-head"]
----
def allocations(orderid):
    batches = redis_eventpublisher.get_readmodel(orderid)
    return [
        {'batchref': b.decode(), 'sku': s.decode()}
        for s, b in batches.items()
    ]
----
====



And the _exact same_ integration tests that we had before still pass,
because they are written at a level of abstraction that's decoupled from the
implementation: setup puts messages on the message bus, and the assertions
are against our view.

TIP: Event handlers are a great way to manage updates to a read model,
    if you decide you need one.  They also make it easy to change the
    implementation of that read model at a later date.
    ((("event handlers", "managing updates to read model")))

.Exercise for the Reader
**********************************************************************
Implement another view, this time to show the allocation for a single
order line.

Here the trade-offs between using hardcoded SQL versus going via a repository
should be much more blurry.  Try a few versions (maybe including going
to Redis), and see which you prefer.
**********************************************************************


=== Wrap-Up

((("views", "trade-offs for view model options")))
((("command-query responsibility segregation (CQRS)", "trade-offs for view model options")))
<<view_model_tradeoffs>> proposes some pros and cons for each of our options.

((("command-query responsibility segregation (CQRS)", "full-blown CQRS versus simpler options")))
As it happens, the allocation service at MADE.com does use "full-blown" CQRS,
with a read model stored in Redis, and even a second layer of cache provided
by Varnish. But its use cases are quite a bit different from what
we've shown here. For the kind of allocation service we're building, it seems
unlikely that you'd need to use a separate read model and event handlers for
updating it.

But as your domain model becomes richer and more complex, a simplified read
model become ever more compelling.

[[view_model_tradeoffs]]
[options="header"]
.Trade-offs of various view model options
|===
| Option | Pros | Cons

| Just use repositories
| Simple, consistent approach.
| Expect performance issues with complex query patterns.

| Use custom queries with your ORM
| Allows reuse of DB configuration and model definitions.
| Adds another query language with its own quirks and syntax.

| Use hand-rolled SQL
| Offers fine control over performance with a standard query syntax.
| Changes to DB schema have to be made to your hand-rolled queries _and_ your
  ORM definitions. Highly normalized schemas may still have performance
  limitations.

| Create separate read stores with events
| Read-only copies are easy to scale out. Views can be constructed when data
  changes so that queries are as simple as possible.
| Complex technique. Harry will be forever suspicious of your tastes and
  motives.
|===

// IDEA (EJ3) Might be useful to re-iterate what "full-blown" CQRS means vs simpler CQRS options.  I think
//      most blog posts describe CQRS in terms of the "full-blown" version, while
//      ignoring over the simpler version that is developed earlier in this chapter.
//
//      In my experience, many people react to CQRS with the response that
//      it's insane/too complex/too-hard and want to fall back to a CRUD hammer.
//

Often, your read operations will be acting on the same conceptual objects as your
write model, so using the ORM, adding some read methods to your repositories,
and using domain model classes for your read operations is _just fine_.

In our book example, the read operations act on quite different conceptual
entities to our domain model. The allocation service thinks in terms of
`Batches` for a single SKU, but users care about allocations for a whole order,
with multiple SKUs, so using the ORM ends up being a little awkward. We'd be
quite tempted to go with the raw-SQL view we showed right at the beginning of
the chapter.

On that note, let's sally forth into our final chapter.
