== A Brief Interlude: On Coupling and Abstractions

.In this chapter
* We'll discuss how to reduce coupling by introducing simple abstractions over
  complex subsystems.
* We'll show how to make complex processes testable by disentangling state from
  logic.

// this chapter is marked as a preface as a hack to disable
// chapter numbering for it in atlas/pdf.  when we go to prod
// we should find a better solution.

// (ej) Looks like some of the intro and concluding text still need updating
// for the move, but I think this is a good candidate for Chapter 1.
//
// If you closed out this chapter with some of the content from the Domain Modeling chapter,
// it could serve as a gentle intro to Ch2 Domain Modeling.
//
//  Hypothetically, a flow that makes sense to me is:
//  Ch1: Abstractions (or maybe Complexity?)
//  - What are the causes of complexity in software? (changing requirements,
//      turnover in teams, conway's law, evolving technologies etc., etc.)
//  - BBOM
//  - How do we manage complexity? -> By organizing code into abstractions and modules.
//  - Content on the filesystem examples, fcis, di, etc. as examples of different styles of abstraction
//  - How do you know what makes a "good" abstraction, or a "good" module decomposition?
//  - Discussion of coupling and cohesion, sep-of-concerns, information hiding principle. (Information
//    hiding pinciple suggests that modules/abstractions should be designed
//    to *hide/encapsulate the things that are most likely to change.*)
//  - 3-layer architecture as a form of information hiding and abstraction.
//  - DDD and domain modeling as a way of choosing abstractions.
//
//  Ch 2. Domain modeling
//  - Jump straight into DDD patterns and product/warehouse modeling.
//

Allow us a brief digression on the subject of abstractions, dear reader.
We've talked about _abstractions_ quite a lot.  The repository is an
abstraction over permanent storage for example.  But what makes a good
abstraction?  What do we want from them?

A key theme in this book, hidden among the fancy patterns, is that we can use
simple abstractions to hide messy details. When we're writing code for fun, or
in a kata, footnote:[We'll talk about TDD kata soon, but if you're new to the
idea check out http://www.peterprovost.org/blog/2012/05/02/kata-the-only-way-to-learn-tdd/]
we get to play with ideas freely, hammering things out and refactoring
aggressively. In a large-scale system, though, we become constrained by the
decisions made elsewhere in the system.

When we're unable to change component A for fear of breaking component B, we say
that the components have become coupled. Locally, coupling is a good thing: it's
a sign that our code is working together, each component supporting the others,
fitting in place like the gears of a watch.

Globally, coupling is a nuisance: it increases the risk and the cost of changing
our code, sometimes to the point where we feel unable to make some changes at
all. This is the problem with the ball of mud pattern: as the application grows,
the coupling increases superlinearly until we are no longer able to effectively
change our systems.

// (ej) I'm reading the preceding two paragraphs as essentially describing coupling vs. cohesion,
//      where "local" coupling implies high cohesion, "global coupling" implies low cohesion.
//      using those terms specifically will let readers google for more info.

We can reduce the degree of coupling within a system
(<<coupling_illustration1>>) by abstracting away the details
(<<coupling_illustration2>>):

In both diagrams, we have a pair of subsystems, with the one dependent on
the other. In the first diagram, there is a high degree of coupling between the
two because of reasons. If we need to change system B, there's a good
chance that the change will ripple through to system A.

In the second, though, we have reduced the degree of coupling by inserting a
new, simpler, abstraction. This abstraction serves to protect us from change by
hiding away the complex details of whatever system B does.

// (ej)
//       I'm a bit of a stickler on semantics of diagrams, but I'm not
//       sure how to interpret the pictures, as they're too abstract.
//
//       In ASCII form, these are:
//       - A <-> B
//       - A <-> Abstraction <-> B
//
//        The double-ended arrow to me implies circular dependency, which means A and B are still
//        coupled in the above diagrams.
//
//       For A and B to be decoupled, the pictures I see in my mind are one of these dependency relationships:
//       - A -> Abstraction -> B
//       - A <- Abstraction <- B
//       - A -> Abstraction <- B
//       - A <- Abstraction -> B

=== Abstracting State Aids Testability

Let's see an example. Imagine we want to write some code for synchronising two
file directories which we'll call the source and the destination.

* If a file exists in the source, but not the destination, copy the file over.
* If a file exists in the source, but has a different name than in the destination,
  rename the destination file to match.
* If a file exists in the destination but not the source, remove it.

Our first and third requirements are simple enough, we can just compare two
lists of paths. Our second is trickier, though. In order to detect renames,
we'll have to inspect the content of files. For this we can use a hashing
function like md5 or SHA. The code to generate a SHA hash from a file is simple
enough.

[[hash_file]]
.Hashing a file (sync.py)
====
[source,python]
----
BLOCKSIZE = 65536

def hash_file(path):
    hasher = hashlib.sha1()  #<2>
    with path.open("rb") as file:
        buf = file.read(BLOCKSIZE)
        while buf:
            hasher.update(buf)
            buf = file.read(BLOCKSIZE)
    return hasher.hexdigest()
----
====

Now we need to write the interesting business logic. When we have to tackle a
problem from first principles, we usually try to write a simple implementation,
and then refactor towards better design. We'll use this approach throughout the
book, because it's how we write code in the real world: start with a solution
to the smallest part of the problem, and then iteratively make the solution
richer and better designed.

Our first hackish approach looks something like this:

            dest_hash = hash_file(dest_path)
            seen.add(dest_hash)

              # if there's a file in target that's not in source, delete it

            if dest_hash not in source_hashes:
                dest_path.remove()

            # if there's a file in target that has a different path in source,
            # move it to the correct path
            elif dest_hash in source_hashes and fn != source_hashes[dest_hash]:
                shutil.move(dest_path, Path(folder) / source_hashes[dest_hash])

    # for every file that appears in source but not target, copy the file to
    # the target
    for src_hash, filename in source_hashes.items():
        if src_hash not in seen:
            shutil.copy(Path(source) / filename, Path(dest) / filename)

Fantastic! We have some code and it _looks_ okay, but before we run it on our
hard drive, maybe we should test it?  How do we go about testing this sort of thing?

Wowsers, that's a lot of setup for two very simple cases! The problem is that
our domain logic, "figure out the difference between two directories," is tightly
coupled to the IO code. We can't run our difference algorithm without calling
the pathlib, shutil, and hashlib modules.

// TODO: Dry run
// (ej)
//     As a motivating "what-if", at this point you could ask the following thought experiments:
//       1) What if you wanted to re-use the same code so this also works synchronizing remote servers?
//       2) What if you wanted to add a "dry-run" feature?
//       What extra complexity would these scenarios create?

Our high-level code is coupled to low-level details, and it's making life hard.
As the scenarios we consider get more complex, our tests will get more unwieldy.
We can definitely refactor these tests (some of the cleanup could go into pytest
fixtures for example) but as long as we're doing filesystem operations, they're
going to stay slow and hard to read and write.

=== Choosing the right abstraction(s)

What could we do to rewrite our code to make it more testable?

Firstly we need to think about what our code needs from the filesystem.
Reading through the code, there are really three distinct things happening.
We can think of these as three distinct _responsibilities_ that the code has.

1. We interrogate the filesystem using `os.walk` and determine hashes for a
   series of paths. This is actually very similar in both the source and the
   destination cases.

2. We decide a file is new, renamed, or redundant.

3. We copy, move, or delete, files to match the source.

Remember that we want to find _simplifying abstractions_ for each of these
responsibilities. That will let us hide the messy details so that we can
focus on the interesting logic.

NOTE: In this chapter we're refactoring some gnarly code into a more testable
    structure by identifying the separate tasks that need to be done and giving
    each task to a clearly defined actor, along similar lines to the `duckduckgo`
    example from the prologue.

For (1) and (2), we've already intuitively started using an abstraction, a
dictionary of hashes to paths, and you may already have been thinking, "why not
use build up a dictionary for the destination folder as well as the source,
then we just compare two dicts?"  That seems like a very nice way to abstract
the current state of the filesystem.

    source_files = {'hash1': 'path1', 'hash2': 'path2'}
    dest_files = {'hash1': 'path1', 'hash2': 'pathX'}

What about moving from step (2) to step (3)?  How can we abstract out the
actual move/copy/delete filesystem interaction? 

We're going to apply a trick here that we'll employ on a grand scale later in
the book. We're going to separate _what_ we want to do from _how_ to do it.
We're going to make our program output a list of commands that look like this:

    ("COPY", "sourcepath", "destpath"),
    ("MOVE", "old", "new"),

Now we could write tests that just use 2 filesystem dicts as inputs, and
expect lists of tuples of strings representing actions as outputs.

Instead of saying "given this actual filesystem, when I run my function,
check what actions have happened?" we say, "given this _abstraction_ of a filesystem,
what _abstraction_ of filesystem actions will happen?"

        ...

=== Implementing our chosen abstractions

That's all very well, but how do we _actually_ write those new
tests, and how do we change our implementation to make it all work?

Our goal is to isolate the clever part of our system, and to be able to test it
thoroughly without needing to set up a real filesystem. We'll create a "core"
of code that has no dependencies on external state, and then see how it responds
when we give it input from the outside world.

Let's start off by splitting the code up to separate the stateful parts from
the logic.

// (ej)
// Referring to the "Coupling" diagram comment previously, the snippet below
// would look like:
//
// determine_actions <- sync -> read_paths_and_hashes
//

<1> The code to build up the dictionary of paths and hashes is now trivially
    easy to write.

<2> The core of our "business logic," which says, "given these two sets of
    hashes and filenames, what should we copy/move/delete?"  takes simple
    data structures and returns simple data structures.

<3> And our top-level module now contains almost no logic whatseover


////
TODO (ej)
ej.1 Calling out the sections that are "shell" and "core" will give the terms some visual impact.
ej.2 I played around with refactoring this a bit, and stunbled across something interesting.

Source + dest are only necessary if you actually want to mutate the filesystem.
You could push the responsibility for forming the absolute paths out to the
"shell".

That then raises the question of whether this function is just detecting
changes in filesystem state, or determining the actions that should be
performed.  The flags could just as easily be {"file created", "file moved",
"file deleted"} instead of {"copy", "move", "delete"}.

IRL this would be unnecessary hair splitting, but for the purposes of this
chapter, maybe it will be useful for discussing modeling + abstractions, and
foreshadowing some of the event stuff in later chapters.  I am unsure if it
will fit into the flow of this text.

Because we've disentangled the logic of our program - the code for identifying
changes - from the low-level details of IO, we can easily test the core of our code.

==== Testing Edge-to-Edge with Fakes

When we start writing a new system, we often focus on the core logic first,
driving it with direct unit tests. At some point, though, we want to test bigger
chunks of the system together.

We _could_ return to our end-to-end tests, but those are still as tricky to
write and maintain as before. Instead, we often write tests that invoke a whole
system together, but fake the IO, sort of _edge-to-edge_.

TIP: Notice that, although we're using dependency injection, there was no need
    to define an abstract base class or any kind of explicit interface.  In the
    book we often show ABCs because we hope they help to understand what the
    abstraction is, but they're not necessary.  Python's dynamic nature means
    we can always rely on duck typing.

<1> Bob _loves_ using lists to build simple test doubles, even though his
co-workers get mad. It means we can write tests like
`assert 'foo' not in database`

<2> Each method in our `FakeFileSystem` just appends something to the list so we
can inspect it later. This is an example of a Spy Object.


The advantage of this approach is that your tests act on the exact same function
that's used by your production code.  The disadvantage is that we have to make
our stateful components explicit and we have to pass them around. DHH famously
described this as "test damage".

In either case, we can now work on fixing all the bugs in our implementation;
enumerating tests for all the edge cases is now much easier.


.So Which Do We Use in this Book? FCIS or DI?
******************************************************************************
Both. Our domain model is entirely free of dependencies and side-effects,
so that's our functional core.  The service layer that we build around it
(in <<chapter_03_service_layer>>) allows us to drive the system edge-to-edge
and we use dependency injection to provide those services with stateful
components, so we can still unit test them.

See <<chapter_10_dependency_injection>> for more exploration of making our
dependency injection more explicit and centralised.
******************************************************************************

=== Wrap-up: "Depend on Abstractions."

We'll see this idea come up again and again in the book: we can make our
systems easier to test and maintain by simplifying the interface between our
business logic and messy IO. Finding the right abstraction is tricky, but here's
a few heuristics and questions to ask yourself:


* Can I choose a familiar Python datastructure to represent the state of the
  messy system, and try to imagine a single function that can return that
  state?
// TODO (DS): These are great heuristics... Maybe they deserve more attention?

* Where can I draw a line between my systems, where can I carve out a seam, to
  stick that abstraction in?

// TODO (DS): Drawing lines and the dependencies between them is really
// relevant to what you've done in this chapter, but i don't think you've
// explicitly addressed them except in this bullet point.
// BOB: This is another ry for clarity on responsibilities. Mayne foreshadow
// in the prologue by explaining that our duckduckgo jobby is a responsibility

// TODO (DS): I think the seam metaphor might need more explanation.
// (I assume this is taken from Michael Feathers? I've always been confused
// about whether it's a sewing seam, or a mining seam!)

// TODO (DS): And maybe, which implicit concepts can i make explicit?

* What are the dependencies and what is the core "business" logic?



Practice makes less-imperfect!

// TODO (DS): I think this is potentially a great chapter, perhaps belonging
// really on in the book. But it is also a bit of a brain dump of lots of deep,
// amazing concepts. I don't think you've quite found the best structure here
// yet. Perhaps it could be structured around these heuristics?

And now back to our regular programming...
