  <h1>About the Authors</h1>
  <p><strong>Harry J.W. Percival</strong> spent a few years being deeply unhappy as a management consultant. Soon he rediscovered his true geek nature and was lucky enough to fall in with a bunch of XP fanatics, working on the pioneering the sadly defunct Resolver One spreadsheet. He worked at PythonAnywhere LLP, spreading the gospel of TDD world-wide at talks, workshops and conferences. He is now with MADE.COM.</p>

  <p><strong>Bob Gregory</strong> is a UK-based software architect with MADE.COM. He has been building event driven systems with domain-driven design for more than a decade.</p>
