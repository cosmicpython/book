== Epilogue: What now?

Phew! We've covered a lot of ground in this book and for most of our audience
all of these ideas are new. With that in mind, we can't hope to make you experts
in these techniques. All we can really do is show you the broad-brush ideas, and
just enough code for you to go ahead and write something from scratch.

The code we've shown in this book isn't battle-hardened production code: it's a
set of lego blocks that you can play with to make your first house, spaceship,
and skyscraper.

That leaves us with two big tasks left for our final chapter. We want to talk
about how to start applying these ideas for real in an existing system, and we
need to warn you about some of the things we had to skip. We've given you a
whole new arsenal of ways to shoot yourself in the foot, so we should discuss
some basic firearms safety.

=== How do I get there from here?

Chances are that a lot of you are thinking something like this:

"OK Bob and Harry, that's all well and good, and if I ever get hired to work
on a green-field new service, I know what to do.  But in the meantime, I'm
here with my big ball of Django mud, and I don't see any way to get to your
nice, clean, perfect, untainted, simplistic model.  Not from here."

We hear you. Once you've already _built_ a big ball of mud, it's hard to know
how to start improving things. Really, we need to tackle things step by step.

First things first: what problem are you trying to solve? Is the software too
hard to change? Is the performance unacceptable? Have you got weird inexplicable
bugs?

Having a clear goal in mind will help you to prioritise the work that needs to
be done and, importantly, communicate the reasons for doing it to the rest of
the team. Businesses tend to have very pragmatic approaches to technical debt
and refactoring, so long as engineers can make a reasoned argument for fixing
things.

TIP: Making complex changes to a system is often an easier sell if you link it
to feature work. Perhaps you're launching a new product, or opening your service
to new markets? This is the right time to spend engineering resources on fixing
the foundations. With a six month project to deliver, it's easier to make the
argument for three weeks of clean-up work. Bob refers to this as "architecture
tax".

=== Separating entangled responsibilities

At the beginning of the book, we said that the main characteristic of a big ball
of mud is homogeneity: every part of the system looks the same, because we
haven't been clear about the responsibilities of each component. To fix that,
we'll need to start separating responsibilities out and introducing some clear
boundaries. One of the first things we can do is to start building a service
layer.

.Case Study: Layering an over-grown system
********************************************************************************
Many years ago, Bob worked for a software company that had outsourced the first
version of their application, an online collaboration platform for sharing and
working on files.

When the company brought development in-house, it passed through several
generations of developers' hands, and each wave of new developers added more
complexity to the code's structure.

At it's heart, the system was an ASP.Net Web Forms application, built with an
NHibernate ORM. Users would upload documents into workspaces, where they could
invite other workspace members to review, comment, or modify their work.

Most of the complexity of the application was in the permissions model since
each document was contained in a folder, and folders allowed read, write, and
edit permissions, much like a Linux filesystem.

Additionally, each workspace belonged to an account, and the account had quotas
attached to it via a billing package.

As a result, every read or write operation against a document had to load an
enormous number of objects from the database in order to test permissions and
quotas. Creating a new workspace involved hundreds of database queries as we set
up the permissions structure, invited users, and set up sample content.

Some of the code for operations was in web handlers that ran when a user clicked
a button or submitted a form, some of it was in "manager" objects that held
code for orchestrating work, and some of it was in the domain model. Model
objects would make database calls, or copy files on disk, and the test coverage
was abysmal.

To fix the problem, we first introduced a service layer so that all of the code
for creating a document or workspace was in one place and could be understood.
This involved pulling data access code out of the domain model and into
command handlers. Likewise, we pulled orchestration code out of the managers and
the web handlers, and pushed it into handlers.

The resulting command handlers were _long_ and messy, but we'd made a start at
introducing order to the chaos.

This was the system where Bob first learned how to break apart a ball of mud,
and it was a doozy. There was logic _everywhere_ - in the web pages, in
"manager" objects, in "helpers", in fat "service" classes that we'd written to
abstract the managers and helpers, and in hairy "command" objects that we'd
written to break apart the services.

If you're working in a system that's reached this point, it can feel hopeless,
but it's never too late to start weeding an overgrown garden. Eventually we
hired an architect who knew what he was doing, and he helped us get things
back under control.

Start by working out the _use cases_ of your system. If you have a
user interface, what actions does it perform? If you've got some back-end
processing component, then maybe each cron job or celery job is a single
use-case. Each of your use cases needs to have an imperative name: "Apply
Billing Charges", "Clean Abandoned Accounts", or "Raise Purchase Order".

In our case, most of our use-cases were part of the manager classes and had
names like "Create Workspace" or "Delete Document Version". Each use-case
was invoked from a web front end.

Our goal is to create a single function or class for each of these supported
operations that deals with _orchestrating_ the work to be done. Each use case
should:

* Start its own database transaction if needed
* Fetch any required data
* Check any preconditions (see the _ensure_ pattern in the validation appendix)
* Update the domain model
* Persist any changes

Each use case should succeed or fail as an atomic unit. You might need to call
one use case from another - that's okay, just make a note of it, and try to
avoid long-running database transactions.

NOTE: One of the biggest problems we had was that manager methods called other
manager methods, and data access could happen from the model objects themselves.
It was hard to understand what each operation did without going on a treasure-
hunt across the codebase. Pulling all the logic into a single method, and using
a unit of work to control our transactions, made the system easier to reason
about.

This is a good opportunity to pull any data-access or orchestration code out of
the domain model and up into the use-cases. We should also try to pull IO
concerns (eg. sending emails, writing files) out of the domain model and up into
the use-case functions. We apply the techniques from <<chapter_03_abstractions>> on abstractions
to keep our handlers unit testable even when they're performing IO.

TIP: It's fine if you've got duplication in the use-case functions. We're not
    trying to write perfect code, we're just trying to extract some meaningful
    layers. It's better to duplicate some code in a few places than to have
    use-case functions calling one another in a long chain.

These use-case functions will mostly be about logging, data access, and error
handling. Once you've done this step, you'll have a grasp of what your program
actually _does_, and a way to make sure each operation has a clearly defined
start and finish. We'll have taken a step toward building a pure domain model.

under test, and how to start separating responsibilities.

=== Identifying Aggregates and Bounded Contexts

Part of the problem with the codebase in our case study was that the object
graph was highly connected. Each account had many workspaces, each workspace had
many members, all of whom had their own accounts. Each workspace contained many
documents, which had many versions.

You can't express the full horror of the thing in a class diagram.
For one thing, there wasn't really a single account related to a user. Instead
there was some bizarre rule where you had to enumerate all of the accounts
associated to the user via the workspaces and take the one with the earliest
creation date.

Every object in the system was part of an inheritance hierarchy that included
SecureObject and Version, and this inheritance hierarchy was mirrored directly
in the database schema, so that every query had to join across ten different
tables and look at a discriminator column just to tell what kind of objects
you were working with.

The codebase made it easy to "dot" your way through these objects like so:

[source,python]
----
user.account.workspaces[0].documents.versions[1].owner.account.settings[0];
----

It's easy to build a system this way with Django ORM or SQLAlchemy but it's
to be avoided. While it's _convenient_, it makes it very hard to reason about
performance because each property might trigger a lookup to the database.

TIP: Aggregates are a _consistency boundary_. In general each use-case should
    update a single aggregate at a time. One handler fetches one aggregate from
    a repository, modifies its state, and raises any events that happen as a
    result. If you need data from another part of the system, it's totally find
    to use a read model, but avoid updating multiple aggregates in a single
    transaction. When we choose to separate code into different aggregates,
    we're explicitly choosing to make them _eventually consistent_ with one
    another.

There were a bunch of operations that required us to loop over objects this way,
for example:

[source,python]
----
# Lock a user's workspaces for non-payment

def lock_account(user):
    for workspace in user.account.workspaces:
        workspace.archive()
----

Or even recurse over collections of folders and documents:

[source,python]
----
def lock_documents_in_folder(folder):

    for doc in folder.documents:
         doc.archive()

     for child in folder.children:
         lock_documents_in_folder(child)
----


These operations _killed_ performance but fixing them meant giving up our single
object graph. Instead we began to identify aggregates and to break the direct
links between objects.

NOTE: We talked about the infamous "select N+1 problem" in <<chapter_11_external_events>>, and how
we might choose to use different techniques when reading data for queries vs
reading data for commands.

Mostly we did this by replacing direct references with identifiers:

TIP: Bi-directional links are often a sign that your aggregates aren't right.
    In our original code, a Document knew about its containing Folder, and the
    Folder had a collection of Documents. This makes it easy to traverse the
    object graph but stops us from thinking properly about the consistency
    boundaries we need. We break apart aggregates by using references instead.
    In the new model, a Document had reference to its `parent_folder` but no way
    to directly access the Folder.

If we needed to _read_ data, we avoided writing complex loops and transforms and
tried to replace them with straight SQL. For example, one of our screens was a
tree view of folders and documents.

This screen was _incredibly_ heavy on the database, because it relied on nested
for loops that triggered a lazy-loaded ORM.

TIP: We use this same technique in the book in <<chapter_11_external_events>> where we replace a
    nested loop over ORM objects with a simple SQL query. It's the first step
    in a CQRS approach.

After a lot of head-scratching, we replaced the ORM code with a big, ugly stored
procedure. The code looked horrible, but it was much faster and it helped us
to break the links between Folder and Document.

When we needed to _write_ data, we changed a single aggregate at a time, and we
introduced a message bus to handle events. For example, in the new model, when
we locked an account, we could first query for all the affected workspaces
`SELECT id FROM workspace WHERE account_id = ?`.

We could then raise a new command for each workspace:

[source,python]
----
for workspace_id in workspaces:
    bus.handle(LockWorkspace(workspace_id))
----


=== An Event-driven Approach to go Microservices Via Strangler Pattern

_Strangler Fig Pattern_ involves creating a new system around the edges
of an old system, while keeping it running. Bits of old functionality
are gradually intercepted and replaced until the old system is left
doing nothing at all, and can be switched off.


.Case Study: Carving out a microservice to replace a domain
********************************************************************************
MADE.com started out with _two_ monoliths: one for the front-end e-commerce
application, and one for the back-end fulfillment system.

The two systems communicated through XML-RPC. Periodically, the back-end system
would wake up and query the front-end system to find out about new orders. When
it had imported all the new orders, it would send RPC commands to update the
stock levels.

Over time this synchronisation process became slower and slower until, one
Christmas, it took longer than 24 hours to import a single day's orders. Bob was
hired to break the system into a set of event-driven services.

Firstly we identified that the slowest part of the process was calculating and
synchronising the available stock. What we needed was a system that could listen
to external events, and keep a running total of how much stock was available.

We exposed that information via an API, so that the user's browser could ask
how much stock was available for each product, and how long it would take to
deliver to their house.

Whenever a product ran out of stock completely, we would raise a new event that
the e-commerce platform could use to take a product off sale. Because we didn't
know how much load we would need to handle, we wrote the system with a CQRS
pattern. Whenever the amount of stock changed, we would update a redis database
with a cached view model. Our flask API queried these "view models" instead of
running the complex domain model.

As a result, we could answer the question "How much stock is available" in two
to three milliseconds and the API frequently handles hundreds of requests a
second for sustained periods.

If this all sounds a little familiar, well, now you know where our example app
came from!
********************************************************************************

When building the availability service we used a technique called _event
interception_ to move functionality from one place to another. This is a three step
process:

1. Raise events to represent the changes happening in a system you want to
replace.

2. Build a second system that consumes those events and uses them to build its
own domain model.

3. Replace the older system with the new.

We used event interception to move from this:

Practically this was a several month project. Our first step was to write a
domain model that could represent batches, shipments, and products. We used TDD
to build a toy system that could answer a single question: "If I want N units of
HAZARDOUS_RUG how long will they take to be delivered?".

Once we had a working domain model, we switched to building out some
infrasructural pieces. Our first production deployment was a tiny system, that
could receive a `batch_created` event, and log its json representation. This is
the "Hello World" of event driven architecture. It forced us to deploy a message
bus, hook up a producer and consumer, build a deployment pipeline, and write a
simple message handler.

TIP: When deploying an event-driven system, start with a "walking skeleton".
    Deploying a system that just logs its input forces us to tackle all the
    infrastructural questions and start working in production.

Given a deployment pipeline, the infrastructure we needed, and a basic domain
model, we were off. A couple of months later we were in production and serving
real customers.

=== Convincing your stakeholders to try something new

If you're thinking about carving a new system out of a big ball of mud, you're
probably suffering problems with reliability, performance, maintainability or
all three simultaneously. Deep intractable problems call for drastic measures!

We recommend _domain modelling_ as a first step. In many over-grown systems, the
engineers, product owners, and customers no longer speak the same language.
Business stakeholders speak about the system in abstract, process-focused terms
while developers are forced to speak about the system as it physically exists in
its wild and chaotic state.

.Case Study: The user model
********************************************************************************
We mentioned earlier that the account and user model in our first system were
bound together by a "bizarre rule". This is a perfect example of how engineering
and business stakeholders can drift apart.

In this system, _accounts_ parented _workspaces_, and users were _members_ of
workspaces. Workspaces were the fundamental unit for applying permissions and
quotas. If a user _joined_ a workspace, and didn't already have an _account_ we
would associate them with the account that owned that workspace.

This was messy and ad-hoc, but it worked fine until the day a product owner
asked for a new feature:

> When a user joins a company, we want to add them to some default workspaces
  for the company, like the HR workspace or the Company Announcements workspace.

We had to explain to them that there was _no such thing_ as a company, and there
was no sense in which a user joined an account. Moreover, a "company" might have
_many_ accounts, owned by different users, and a new user might be invited to
any one of them.

Years of adding hacks and workarounds to a broken model caught up with us, and
we had to rewrite the entire user management function as a brand new system.

********************************************************************************

Figuring out how to model your domain is a complex task, and the subject of many
decent books in its own right. We like to use interactive techniques like Event
Storming, and CRC modelling, because humans are good at collaborating through
play. Event Modelling is another technique that brings engineers and product
owners together to understand a system in terms of commands, queries, and events.

TIP: Check out www.eventmodelling.org and www.eventstorming.org for some great
guides to visual modelling of systems with events.

The goal is to be able to talk about the system using the same ubiquitous
language, so that you can agree on where the complexity lies.

We've found a lot of value in treating domain problems as TDD kata. For example,
the first code we wrote for the availability service was the batch and order
line model. You can treat this as a lunch time workshop, or as a spike at the
beginning of a project. Once you can demonstrate the value of modelling, it's
easier to make the argument for structuring the project to make modelling easy.



.Case Study: David Seddon on Taking Small Steps
*******************************************************************************

_Hi, I'm David - one of the tech reviewers on this book. I've worked on
several complex Django monoliths, and so I've known the pain that Bob and
Harry have made all sorts of grand promises about soothing._

_When I was first exposed to the patterns described here, I was rather
excited. I had successfully used some of the techniques already on
smaller projects, but here was a blueprint for much larger, database-backed
systems like the one I work on in my day job. So, I started trying to figure
out how I could implement it at my current organization._
 
_I chose to tackle a problem area of the code base that had always bothered me.
I began by implementing it as a use case. But I found myself running
into unexpected questions. There were things that I hadn't considered
while reading that now made it difficult to see what to do. Was it a
problem if my use case interacted with two different aggregates? Could
one use case call another? And how was it going to exist within
a system that followed different architectural principles without resulting
in a horrible mess?_

_What happened to that oh-so-promising blueprint? Did I actually understand
the ideas well enough to put them into practice? Was it even suitable for my
application? Even if it was, would any of my colleagues agree to such a
major change? Were these just nice ideas for me to fantasize about while I got
on with real life?_

_It took me a while to realize that I could start small. I didn't
need to be a purist, or to 'get it right' first time: I could experiment,
finding what worked for me._

_And so that's what I've done. I've been able to apply *some* of the ideas
in a few places. I've built new features whose business logic
can be tested without the database or mocks. And as a team we've
introduced a service layer to help define the jobs the system does._

_If you start trying to apply these patterns in your work, you may go through
similar feelings to begin with. When the nice theory of a book meets the reality
of your code base, it can be demoralizing._

_My advice is to focus on a specific problem and ask yourself how you can
put the relevant ideas to use, perhaps in an initially limited and imperfect fashion.
You may discover, as I did, that the first problem you pick might be a bit too difficult
-  if so, move on to something else. Don't try to boil the ocean, and don't be *too*
afraid of making mistakes. It will be a learning experience, and you can be confident
that you're moving roughly in a direction that others have found useful._

_So, if you're feeling the pain too - give these ideas a try. Don't feel you need permission
to rearchitect everything - just look for somewhere small to start. And above all, do it
to solve a specific problem. If you're successful in solving it, you know you got something
right - and others will too._

*******************************************************************************



=== Questions our Tech Reviewers Asked That We Couldn't Work Into Prose

Do I need to do all of this at once? Can I just do a bit at a time?::
    No, you can absolutely adopt these techniques bit by bit. We recommend, if you
    have an existing system, building a service layer to try and keep orchestration
    in one place. Once you have that, it's much easier to push logic into the model
    and edge concerns like validation, or error handling, to the entry points.
    +++<br />+++
    It's worth having a service layer even if you still have a big messy Django ORM
    because it's a way to start understanding the boundaries of operations.

Extracting use-cases will break a lot of my existing code, it's too tangled::
    Just copy-paste. It's okay to cause more duplication in the short-term. Think of
    this as a multi-step process. Your code is in a bad state now, so copy and paste
    it to a new place, and then make that new code clean and tidy.
    +++<br />+++
    Once you've done that, you can replace uses of the old code with calls to your
    new code and finally delete the mess. Fixing large code bases is a messy and
    painful process. Don't expect things to get instantly better, and don't worry if
    some bits of your application stay messy.

Do I need to do CQRS? That sounds weird, can't I just use repositories?::
    Of course you can! The techniques we're presenting in this book are intended to
    make your life _easier_, they're not some kind of ascetic discipline with which
    to punish yourself.
    +++<br />+++
    In our first case-study system, we had a lot of "View Builder" objects that used
    repositories to fetch data and then performed some transformations to return
    dumb read models. The advantage is that when you hit a performance problem, it's
    easy to rewrite a view builder to use custom queries or raw SQL.

How should use cases interact across a larger system? Is it a problem for one to call another?::
    This might be an interim step. Again, in the first case-study, we had handlers
    that would need to invoke other handlers. This gets _really_ messy, though, and
    it's much better to move to using a message bus to separate these concerns.
    +++<br />+++
    Generally, your system will have a single message bus implementation, and a
    bunch of different subdomains that center on a particular aggregate or set of
    aggregates. When your use case has finished, it can raise an event, and a
    handler elsewhere can run.

Is it a smell for a use case to use multiple repositories/aggregates, and why?::
    An aggregate is a consistency boundary, so if your use case needs to update
    two aggregates atomically (within the same transaction), then your
    consistency boundary is wrong, strictly speaking.  Ideally you should think
    about moving to a new aggregate that wraps up all the things you want to 
    change at the same time.
    +++<br />+++
    If you're actually only updating one aggregate, and using the other(s) for
    read-only access, then that's _fine_, although you could consider building a
    read model / view to get you that data instead--it makes things cleaner if
    each use case only has one aggregate.
    +++<br />+++
    If you do need to modify two aggregates, but the two operations don't have to be
    in the same transaction/UoW, then consider splitting the work out into two
    different handlers and using a domain event to carry information between the two.
    You can read more in
    https://dddcommunity.org/wp-content/uploads/files/pdf_articles/Vernon_2011_1.pdf[these papers on aggregate design]
    by Vaughn Vernon.

What if I have a read-only but business-logic heavy system?::
    View models can have complex logic in them. In this book we've encouraged you to
    separate your read and write models because they have different consistency and
    throughput requirements. Mostly, we can use simpler logic for reads, but that's
    not always true. In particular, permissions and authorization models can add a
    lot of complexity to our read-side.
    +++<br />+++
    We've written systems where the view models needed extensive unit tests. In
    those systems, we split a _view builder_ from a _view fetcher_, as in
    <<view_builder_diagram>>.

This makes it easy to test the view builder by giving it mocked data, eg. a list
of dicts.

"Fancy CQRS" with event handlers is really a way of running our complex view
logic whenever we write so that we can avoid running it when we read.

Do I need to build microservices to do this stuff?::
    Egads, no! These techniques pre-date microservices by a decade or so. Aggregates,
    domain events, and dependency inversion are ways to control complexity in large
    systems. It so happens that when you've built a set of use cases and a model
    for a business process, it's relatively easy to move it to its own service, but
    that's not a requirement.

I'm using Django, can I still do this?::
    We have an entire appendix, just for you! <<appendix_django>>

=== Footguns

Okay, so we've give you a whole bunch of new toys to play with, here's the
fine print. Harry and Bob do not recommend that you copy-paste our code into
a production system and rebuild your automated trading platform on Redis
pub-sub. For reasons of brevity and simplicity, we've hand-waved a lot of tricky
subjects. Here's a list of things we think you should know before trying this
for real.

==== Reliable messaging is hard

Redis PUBSUB is not reliable and shouldn't be used as a general purpose
messaging tool. We picked it because it's familiar and easy to run. At MADE we
run Eventstore as our messaging tool, but we've had experience with Rabbit and
AWS EventBridge.

Tyler Treat has some excellent blog posts on his site bravenewgeek.com and you
should read at least:

 * https://bravenewgeek.com/you-cannot-have-exactly-once-delivery/[You cannot have exactly-once delivery].
 * https://bravenewgeek.com/what-you-want-is-what-you-dont-understanding-trade-offs-in-distributed-messaging/[Understanding tradeoffs in distributed messaging].

==== We explicitly choose small, focused transactions that can fail independently

In <<chapter_08_events_and_message_bus>> we update our process so that _deallocating_ an order line and
_reallocating_ the line happen in two separate units of work.
You will need monitoring to know when these transactions fail, and tooling to
replay events. Some of this is made easier by using a transaction log as your
message broker (eg. Kafka, EventStore). You might also look at the 
https://microservices.io/patterns/data/transactional-outbox.html[Outbox pattern].

==== We don't discuss idempotency

We haven't given any real thought to what happens when handlers are retried.
In practice you will want to make handlers idempotent so that calling them
repeatedly with the same message will not make repeated changes to state.
This is a key technique for building reliability, because it enables us to
safely retry events when they fail.

There's a lot of good material on idempotent message handling, try starting
here:

* https://blog.sapiensworks.com/post/2015/08/26/How-To-Ensure-Idempotency[How to ensure idempotency].
* https://lostechies.com/jimmybogard/2013/06/03/un-reliability-in-messaging-idempotency-and-de-duplication/[Un-reliability in messaging].

==== Your events will need to change their schema over time

You'll need to find some way of documenting your events and sharing schema
with consumers. We like using JSON schema and markdown because it's simple but
there is other prior art.

  https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34327067-versioning-in-an-event-sourced-system[managing event-driven systems over time]:


=== More required reading

A couple more books we'd like to recommend to help you on your way:

* https://leanpub.com/clean-architectures-in-python[Clean Architectures in Python]
  by Leonardo Giordani, which came out in 2019, is one of the few previous
  books on application architecture in Python.

* https://martinfowler.com/books/eip.html[Enterprise Integration Patterns] by
  Hohpe and Woolf is a pretty good start for messaging patterns.

* _Monolith to Microservices_ by Sam Newman, and his original book,
  _Building Microservices_. Strangler (Fig) pattern is mentioned as a
  favorite, also many others.  Good if you're thinking of moving to
  microservices, and also on integration patterns and the considerations
  of async messaging-based integration.


=== Wrap-Up

Phew! That's a lot of warnings and further reading suggestions, we hope we
haven't scared you off completely. Our goal with this book has been to give you
just enough knowledge and intuition that you can start building some of this
for yourself. We would love to hear how you get on and what problems you're
facing with the techniques in your own systems, so why not get in touch with us
over at www.cosmicpython.com ?
