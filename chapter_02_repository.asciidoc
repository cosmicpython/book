== Repository Pattern

It's time to make good on our promise to use the dependency inversion principle as
a way of decoupling our core logic from infrastructural concerns.

We'll introduce the _Repository_ pattern, a simplifying abstraction over data storage,
allowing us to decouple our model layer from the data layer.((("data storage, Repository pattern and")))((("Repository pattern"))) We'll present a
concrete example of how this simplifying abstraction makes our system more
testable by hiding the complexities of the database.((("storage", seealso="repositories; Repository pattern")))

<<maps_chapter_02>> shows a little preview of what we're going to build:
a `Repository` object that sits between our domain model and the database.

=== Persisting Our Domain Model

In <<chapter_01_domain_model>> we built a simple domain model that can allocate orders
to batches of stock.((("domain model", "persisting"))) It's easy for us to write tests against this code because
there aren't any dependencies or infrastructure to set up. If we needed to run
a database or an API and create test data, our tests would be harder to write
and maintain.

Sadly, at some point we'll need to put our perfect little model in the hands of
users and contend with the real world of spreadsheets and web
browsers and race conditions. For the next few chapters we're going to look at
how we can connect our idealized domain model to external state.

We expect to be working in an agile manner, so our priority is to get to a
minimum viable product as quickly as possible.((("minimum viable product"))) In our case, that's going to be
a web API. In a real project, you might dive straight in with some end-to-end
tests and start plugging in a web framework, test-driving things outside-in.

But we know that, no matter what, we're going to need some form of persistent
storage, and this is a textbook, so we can allow ourselves a tiny bit more
bottom-up development and start to think about storage and databases.


=== Some Pseudocode: What Are We Going to Need?

When we build our first API endpoint, we know we're going to have
some code that looks more or less like the following.

[[api_endpoint_pseudocode]]
.What our first API endpoint will look like
====
[role="skip"]

@flask.route.gubbins
def allocate_endpoint():
    # extract order line from request
    line = OrderLine(request.params, ...)
    # load all batches from the DB
    batches = ...
    # call our domain service
    allocate(line, batches)
    # then save the allocation back to the database somehow
    return 201
----
====

NOTE: We've used Flask because it's lightweight, but you don't need
to be a Flask user to understand this book.((("Flask framework"))) In fact, we'll show you how
to make your choice of framework a minor detail.

We'll need a way to retrieve batch info from the database and instantiate our domain
model objects from it, and we'll also need a way of saving them back to the
database.

_What? Oh, "gubbins" is a British word for "stuff." You can just ignore that. It's pseudocode, OK?_


=== Applying the DIP to Data Access

As mentioned in the <<introduction, introduction>>, a layered architecture is ((("data access, applying dependency inversion principle to")))((("layered architecture")))a common
 approach to structuring a system that has a UI, some logic, and a database (see
<<layered_architecture2>>).

[role="width-75"]
[[layered_architecture2]]
.Layered architecture
image::images/apwp_0202.png[]


Django's Model-View-Template structure is closely related, as is
Model-View-Controller (MVC). In any case, the aim is to keep the layers
separate (which is a good thing), and to have each layer depend only on the one
below it.

But we want((("dependencies", "none in domain model"))) our domain model to have __no dependencies whatsoever__.footnote:[
I suppose we mean "no stateful dependencies." Depending on a helper library is
fine; depending on an ORM or a web framework is not.]
We don't want infrastructure concerns bleeding over into our domain model and
slowing our unit tests or our ability to make changes.

Instead, as discussed in the introduction, we'll ((("onion architecture")))think of our model as being on the
"inside," and dependencies flowing inward to it; this is what people sometimes call
_onion architecture_ (see <<onion_architecture>>).

.Is This Ports and Adapters?
****
If you've been reading about architectural patterns, you may be asking
yourself questions like this:

____
_Is this ports and adapters? Or is it hexagonal architecture? Is that the same as onion architecture? What about the clean architecture? What's a port, and what's an adapter? Why do you people have so many words for the same thing?_
____

Although some people like to nitpick over the differences, all these are
pretty much names for the same thing, and((("Seemann, Mark, blog post")))((("dependency inversion principle"))) they all boil down to the
dependency inversion principle: high-level modules (the domain) should
not depend on low-level ones (the infrastructure).footnote:[Mark Seemann has
https://oreil.ly/LpFS9[an excellent blog post]
on the topic.]

We'll get into some of the nitty-gritty around "depending on abstractions,"
and whether there is a Pythonic equivalent of interfaces,
<<depend_on_abstractions,later in the book>>. See also <<what_is_a_port_and_what_is_an_adapter>>.
****


=== Reminder: Our Model

Let's remind ((("domain model", id="ix_domod")))ourselves of our domain model (see <<model_diagram_reminder>>):
an allocation is the concept of linking an `OrderLine` to a `Batch`.  We're
storing the allocations as a collection on our `Batch` object.

[[model_diagram_reminder]]
.Our model
image::images/apwp_0103.png[]
// see chapter_01_domain_model for diagram source

Let's see how we might translate this to a relational database.


==== The "Normal" ORM Way: Model Depends on ORM

These days, it's unlikely that your team members are hand-rolling their own SQL queries.((("domain model", "translating to relational database", "normal ORM way, model depends on ORM")))
Instead, you're almost certainly using some kind of framework to generate
SQL for you based on your model objects.((("SQL", "generating for domain model objects")))

These frameworks are called _object-relational mappers_ (ORMs) because they exist to((("object-relational mappers (ORMs)")))
bridge the conceptual gap between the world of objects and domain modeling and
the world of databases and relational algebra.

The most important thing an ORM gives us is _persistence ignorance_: the idea
that our fancy domain model doesn't need to know anything about how data is
loaded or persisted. ((("persistence ignorance")))This helps keep our domain clean of direct dependencies
on particular database technologies.footnote:[In this sense, using an ORM is
already an example of the DIP. Instead of depending on hardcoded SQL, we depend
on an abstraction, the ORM. But that's not enough for us—not in this book!]

But if you follow the((("SQLAlchemy", "declarative syntax, model depends on ORM")))((("object-relational mappers (ORMs)", "SQLAlchemy, model depends on ORM"))) typical SQLAlchemy tutorial, you'll end up with something
like this:


[[typical_sqlalchemy_example]]
.SQLAlchemy "declarative" syntax, model depends on ORM (orm.py)
====
[role="skip"]
[source,python]
----
from sqlalchemy import Column, ForeignKey, Integer, String
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base
from sqlalchemy.orm import relationship

Base = declarative_base()

class Order(Base):
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)

class OrderLine(Base):
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    sku = Column(String(250))
    qty = Integer(String(250))
    order_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('order.id'))
    order = relationship(Order)

class Allocation(Base):
    ...
----
====

You don't need to understand SQLAlchemy to see that our pristine model is now
full of dependencies on the ORM and is starting to look ugly as hell besides.
Can we really say this model is ignorant of the database? How can it be
separate from storage concerns when our model properties are directly coupled
to database columns?

[role="nobreakinside less_space"]
.Django's ORM Is Essentially the Same, but More Restrictive
****

If you're more((("Django", "ORM example")))((("object-relational mappers (ORMs)", "Django ORM example"))) used to Django, the preceding "declarative" SQLAlchemy snippet
translates to something like this:

[[django_orm_example]]
.Django ORM example
====
[source,python]
[role="skip"]
----
class Order(models.Model):
    pass

class OrderLine(models.Model):
    sku = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    qty = models.IntegerField()
    order = models.ForeignKey(Order)

class Allocation(models.Model):
    ...
----
====

The point is the same--our model classes inherit directly from ORM
classes, so our model depends on the ORM.  We want it to be the other
way around.

Django doesn't provide an equivalent for SQLAlchemy's classical mapper,
but see <<appendix_django>> for examples of how to apply dependency
inversion and the Repository pattern to Django.

==== Inverting the Dependency: ORM Depends on Model

Well, thankfully, that's not the only way to use SQLAlchemy.((("object-relational mappers (ORMs)", "ORM depends on the data model")))((("domain model", "translating to relational database", "ORM depends on the model")))((("dependency inversion principle", "ORM depends on the data model")))((("SQLAlchemy", "explicit ORM mapping with SQLAlchemy Table objects")))((("classical mapping")))((("mappers")))  The alternative is
to define your schema separately, and to define an explicit _mapper_ for how to convert
between the schema and our domain model, what SQLAlchemy calls a
https://oreil.ly/ZucTG[classical mapping]:

[role="nobreakinside less_space"]
[[sqlalchemy_classical_mapper]]
.Explicit ORM mapping with SQLAlchemy Table objects (orm.py)
====
[source,python]
----
from sqlalchemy.orm import mapper, relationship

import model  #<1>


metadata = MetaData()

order_lines = Table(  #<2>
    'order_lines', metadata,
    Column('id', Integer, primary_key=True, autoincrement=True),
    Column('sku', String(255)),
    Column('qty', Integer, nullable=False),
    Column('orderid', String(255)),
)

...

def start_mappers():
    lines_mapper = mapper(model.OrderLine, order_lines)  #<3>
----
====

<1> The ORM imports (or "depends on" or "knows about") the domain model, and
    not the other way around.

<2> We define our database tables and columns by using SQLAlchemy's
    abstractions.footnote:[Even in projects where we don't use an ORM, we
    often use SQLAlchemy alongside Alembic to declaratively create
    schemas in Python and to manage migrations, connections,
    and sessions.]

<3> When we call the `mapper` function, SQLAlchemy does its magic to bind
    our domain model classes to the various tables we've defined.

The end result will be that, if we call `start_mappers`, we will be able to
easily load and save domain model instances from and to the database. But if
we never call that function, our domain model classes stay blissfully
unaware of the database.

This gives us all the benefits of SQLAlchemy, including the ability to use
`alembic` for migrations, and the ability to transparently query using our
domain classes, as we'll see.

When you're first trying to build your ORM config, it can be useful to write
tests for it, as in the ((("object-relational mappers (ORMs)", "ORM depends on the data model", "testing the ORM")))following example:


[[orm_tests]]
.Testing the ORM directly (throwaway tests) (test_orm.py)

def test_orderline_mapper_can_load_lines(session):  #<1>
    session.execute(
        'INSERT INTO order_lines (orderid, sku, qty) VALUES '
        '("order1", "RED-CHAIR", 12),'
        '("order1", "RED-TABLE", 13),'
        '("order2", "BLUE-LIPSTICK", 14)'
    )
    expected = [
        model.OrderLine("order1", "RED-CHAIR", 12),
        model.OrderLine("order1", "RED-TABLE", 13),
        model.OrderLine("order2", "BLUE-LIPSTICK", 14),
    ]
    assert session.query(model.OrderLine).all() == expected


def test_orderline_mapper_can_save_lines(session):
    new_line = model.OrderLine("order1", "DECORATIVE-WIDGET", 12)
    session.add(new_line)
    session.commit()

    rows = list(session.execute('SELECT orderid, sku, qty FROM "order_lines"'))
    assert rows == [("order1", "DECORATIVE-WIDGET", 12)]
----
====

<1> If you haven't used pytest, the `session` argument to this test needs
    explaining. ((("pytest", "session argument")))You don't need to worry about the details of pytest or its
    fixtures for the purposes of this book, but the short explanation is that
    you can define common dependencies for your tests as "fixtures," and
    pytest will inject them to the tests that need them by looking at their
    function arguments. In this case, it's a SQLAlchemy database session.

////
[SG] I set up the conftest to have a session, and could only get the tests to
work if I dropped the (frozen=True) on the OrderLine dataclass, otherwise I
would get dataclasses.FrozenInstanceError: cannot assign to field
'_sa_instance_state' I feel I am having to work quite hard to follow along ;-(.

Is not spelling everything out a deliberate tactic to make the reader learn?
////

You probably wouldn't keep these tests around--as you'll see shortly, once
you've taken the step of inverting the dependency of ORM and domain model, it's
only a small additional step to implement another abstraction called the
Repository pattern, which will be easier to write tests against and will
provide a simple interface for faking out later in tests.

But we've already achieved our objective of inverting the traditional
dependency: the domain model stays "pure" and free from infrastructure
concerns. We could throw away SQLAlchemy and use a different ORM, or a totally
different persistence system, and the domain model doesn't need to change at
all.


Depending on what you're doing in your domain model, and especially if you
stray far from the OO paradigm, you may find it increasingly hard to get the
ORM to produce the exact behavior you need, and you may need to modify your
domain model.footnote:[Shout-out to the amazingly helpful SQLAlchemy
maintainers, and to Mike Bayer in particular.] As so often happens with
architectural decisions, you'll need to consider a trade-off. As the
Zen of Python says, "Practicality beats purity!"

At this ((("SQLAlchemy", "using directly in API endpoint")))point, though, our API endpoint might look something like
the following, and we could get it to work just fine:

        request.json['sku'],
        request.json['qty'],
    )

    # load all batches from the DB
    batches = session.query(Batch).all()

    # call our domain service
    allocate(line, batches)

    # save the allocation back to the database
    session.commit()

    return 201
----
====

////
[SG] from what I remember of the previous code if none of the batches can_allocate then this
allocate(line, batches) will raise OutOfStock.  Is it OK to let this bubble up?  Should you
add a try finally to close the session
////

=== Introducing the Repository Pattern

The _Repository_ pattern is an abstraction over persistent storage.((("domain model", startref="ix_domod")))((("Repository pattern", id="ix_Repo"))) It hides the
boring details of data access by pretending that all of our data is in memory.

If we had infinite memory in our laptops, we'd have no need for clumsy databases.
Instead, we could just use our objects whenever we liked. What would that look
like?

[[all_my_data]]
.You have to get your data from somewhere
====
[role="skip"]
[source,python]
----
import all_my_data

def create_a_batch():
    batch = Batch(...)
    all_my_data.batches.add(batch)

def modify_a_batch(batch_id, new_quantity):
    batch = all_my_data.batches.get(batch_id)
    batch.change_initial_quantity(new_quantity)

----
====


Even though our objects are in memory, we need to put them _somewhere_ so we can
find them again. Our in-memory data would let us add new objects, just like a
list or a set. Because the objects are in memory, we never need to call a
`.save()` method; we just fetch the object we care about and modify it in memory.


==== The Repository in the Abstract

The simplest repository has just((("Repository pattern", "simplest possible repository"))) two methods: `add()` to put a new item in the
repository, and `get()` to return a previously added item.footnote:[
You may be thinking, "What about `list` or `delete` or `update`?" However, in an
ideal world, we modify our model objects one at a time, and delete is
usually handled as a soft-delete—i.e., `batch.cancel()`.((("Unit of Work pattern"))) Finally, update is
taken care of by the Unit of Work pattern, as you'll see in <<chapter_06_uow>>.]
We stick rigidly to using these methods for data access in our domain and our
service layer. This self-imposed simplicity stops us from coupling our domain
model to the database.

Here's what((("abstract base classes (ABCs)", "ABC for the repository"))) an abstract base class (ABC) for our repository would look like:

[[abstract_repo]]
.The simplest possible repository (repository.py)
====
[source,python]
----
class AbstractRepository(abc.ABC):

    @abc.abstractmethod  #<1>
    def add(self, batch: model.Batch):
        raise NotImplementedError  #<2>

    @abc.abstractmethod
    def get(self, reference) -> model.Batch:
        raise NotImplementedError
----
====


<1> Python tip: `@abc.abstractmethod` is one of the only things that makes
    ABCs actually "work" in Python.((("abstract methods")))((("@abc.abstractmethod"))) Python will refuse to let you instantiate
    a class that does not implement all the `abstractmethods` defined in its
    parent class.footnote:[To really reap the benefits of ABCs (such as they
may be), be running helpers like `pylint` and `mypy`.]

<2> `raise NotImplementedError` is nice, but it's neither necessary nor sufficient. In fact, your abstract methods can have real behavior that subclasses
    can call out to, if you really want.

.Abstract Base Classes, Duck Typing, and Protocols
*******************************************************************************

We're using abstract base classes in this book for didactic reasons: we hope
they help explain what the interface of the repository abstraction is.((("protocols, abstract base classes, duck typing, and")))((("abstract base classes (ABCs)", "using duck typing and protocols instead of")))

In real life, we've sometimes found ourselves deleting ABCs from our production
code, because Python makes it too easy to ignore them, and they end up
unmaintained and, at worst, misleading.((("duck typing"))) In practice we often just rely on
Python's duck typing to enable abstractions. To a Pythonista, a repository is
_any_ object that has pass:[<code>add(<em>thing</em>)</code>] and pass:[<code>get(<em>id</em>)</code>] methods.

An alternative to look into is https://oreil.ly/q9EPC[PEP
544 protocols]. ((("PEP 544 protocols")))These give you typing without the possibility of inheritance,
which "prefer composition over inheritance" fans will particularly like.

==== What Is the Trade-Off?


[quote, Rich Hickey]
____
You know they say economists know the price of everything and the value of
nothing?  Well, programmers know the benefits of everything and the trade-offs
of nothing.
____

Whenever we introduce((("Repository pattern", "trade-offs"))) an architectural pattern in this book, we'll always
ask, "What do we get for this?  And what does it cost us?"

Usually, at the very least, we'll be introducing an extra layer of abstraction,
and although we may hope it will reduce complexity overall, it does add
complexity locally, and it has a cost in terms of the raw numbers of moving parts and
ongoing maintenance.

The Repository pattern is probably one of the easiest choices in the book, though,
if you're already heading down the DDD and dependency inversion route.  As far
as our code is concerned, we're really just swapping the SQLAlchemy abstraction
(`session.query(Batch)`) for a different one (`batches_repo.get`) that we
designed.

We will have to write a few lines of code in our repository class each time we
add a new domain object that we want to retrieve, but in return we get a
simple abstraction over our storage layer, which we control. The Repository pattern would make
it easy to make fundamental changes to the way we store things (see
<<appendix_csvs>>), and as we'll see, it is easy to fake out for unit tests.

In addition, the ((("domain driven design (DDD)", "Repository pattern and")))Repository pattern is so common in the DDD world that, if you
do collaborate with programmers who have come to Python from the Java and C#
worlds, they're likely to recognize it. <<repository_pattern_diagram>> illustrates the pattern.

As always, we start with a test.((("Repository pattern", "testing the  repository with saving an object"))) This would probably be classified as an
integration test, since we're checking that our code (the repository) is
correctly integrated with the database; hence, the tests tend to mix
raw SQL with calls and assertions on our own code.((("SQL", "repository test for saving an object")))

TIP: Unlike the ORM tests from earlier, these tests are good candidates for
    staying part of your codebase longer term, particularly if any parts of
    your domain model mean the object-relational map is nontrivial.

<1> `repo.add()` is the method under test here.

<2> We keep the `.commit()` outside of the repository and make
    it the responsibility of the caller. There are pros and cons for
    this; some of our reasons will become clearer when we get to
    <<chapter_06_uow>>.

<3> We use the raw SQL to verify that the right data has been saved.

The next test involves((("SQL", "repository test for retrieving complex object")))((("Repository pattern", "testing the repository with retrieving a complex object"))) retrieving batches and allocations, so it's more
complex:


[[repo_test_retrieve]]

        'SELECT id FROM order_lines WHERE orderid=:orderid AND sku=:sku',
        dict(orderid="order1", sku="GENERIC-SOFA")
    )
    return orderline_id

def insert_batch(session, batch_id):  #<2>

    expected = model.Batch("batch1", "GENERIC-SOFA", 100, eta=None)
    assert retrieved == expected  # Batch.__eq__ only compares reference  #<3>
    assert retrieved.sku == expected.sku  #<4>
    assert retrieved._purchased_quantity == expected._purchased_quantity
    assert retrieved._allocations == {  #<4>
        model.OrderLine("order1", "GENERIC-SOFA", 12),
    }
----
====


<1> This tests the read side, so the raw SQL is preparing data to be read
    by the `repo.get()`.

<2> We'll spare you the details of `insert_batch` and `insert_allocation`;
    the point is to create a couple of batches, and, for the
    batch we're interested in, to have one existing order line allocated to it.

<3> And that's what we verify here. The first `assert ==` checks that the
    types match, and that the reference is the same (because, as you remember,
    `Batch` is an entity, and we have a custom ++__eq__++ for it).

<4> So we also explicitly check on its major attributes, including
    `._allocations`, which is a Python set of `OrderLine` value objects.

Whether or not you painstakingly write tests for every model is a judgment
call. Once you have one class tested for create/modify/save, you might be
happy to go on and do the others with a minimal round-trip test, or even nothing
at all, if they all follow a similar pattern. In our case, the ORM config
that sets up the `._allocations` set is a little complex, so it merited a
specific test.((("Repository pattern", "typical repository")))


You end up with something like this:


[[batch_repository]]
.A typical repository (repository.py)
====
[source,python]
----
class SqlAlchemyRepository(AbstractRepository):

    def __init__(self, session):
        self.session = session

    def add(self, batch):
        self.session.add(batch)

    def get(self, reference):
        return self.session.query(model.Batch).filter_by(reference=reference).one()

    def list(self):
        return self.session.query(model.Batch).all()
----
====


And now our ((("APIs", "using repository directly in API endpoint")))((("Repository pattern", "using repository directly in API endpoint")))((("Flask framework", "API endpoint")))Flask endpoint might look something like the following:

[[api_endpoint_with_repo]]
.Using our repository directly in our API endpoint
====

[source,python]
----
@flask.route.gubbins
def allocate_endpoint():
    batches = SqlAlchemyRepository.list()
    lines = [
        OrderLine(l['orderid'], l['sku'], l['qty'])
         for l in request.params...
    ]
    allocate(lines, batches)
    session.commit()
    return 201

.Exercise for the Reader
******************************************************************************
We bumped into a friend at a DDD conference the other day who said, "I haven't
used an ORM in 10 years." The Repository pattern and an ORM both act as abstractions((("object-relational mappers (ORMs)", "Repository pattern and")))((("Repository pattern", "ORMs and")))((("SQL", "ORM and Repository pattern as abstractions in front of")))
in front of raw SQL, so using one behind the other isn't really necessary.  Why
not have a go at implementing our repository without using the ORM? You'll find the code https://github.com/cosmicpython/code/tree/chapter_02_repository_exercise[on GitHub].

We've left the repository tests, but figuring out what SQL to write is up
to you. Perhaps it'll be harder than you think; perhaps it'll be easier.
But the nice thing is, the rest of your application just doesn't care.

******************************************************************************


=== Building a Fake Repository for Tests Is Now Trivial!

Here's one of the biggest ((("Repository pattern", "building fake repository for tests")))((("set, fake repository as wrapper around")))benefits of the Repository pattern:


[[fake_repository]]
.A simple fake repository using a set (repository.py)
====
[role="skip"]
[source,python]
----
class FakeRepository(AbstractRepository):

    def __init__(self, batches):
        self._batches = set(batches)

    def add(self, batch):
        self._batches.add(batch)

    def get(self, reference):
        return next(b for b in self._batches if b.reference == reference)

    def list(self):
        return list(self._batches)
----
====

Because it's a simple wrapper around a `set`, all the methods are one-liners.

Using a fake repo in tests is really easy, and we have a simple
abstraction that's easy to use and reason about:

[[fake_repository_example]]
.Example usage of fake repository (test_api.py)
====
[role="skip"]
[source,python]
----
fake_repo = FakeRepository([batch1, batch2, batch3])
----
====

You'll see this fake in action in the next chapter.


TIP: Building fakes for your abstractions is an excellent way to get design
    feedback: if it's hard to fake, the abstraction is probably too
    complicated.


[[what_is_a_port_and_what_is_an_adapter]]
=== What Is a Port and What Is an Adapter, in Python?

We don't want to dwell on the terminology too much here because the main thing
we want to focus on is dependency inversion, and the specifics of the
technique you use don't matter too much. Also, we're aware that different
people use slightly different definitions.((("ports", "defined")))

Ports and adapters came out of the OO world, and the definition we hold onto
is that the _port_ is the _interface_ between our application and whatever
it is we wish to abstract away, and the _adapter_ is the _implementation_
behind that interface or abstraction.((("adapters", "defined")))

Now Python doesn't have interfaces((("interfaces, Python and"))) per se, so although it's
usually easy to identify an adapter, defining the port can be harder. If
you're using an abstract base class, that's the port.((("duck typing", "for ports")))((("abstract base classes (ABCs)", "using for ports"))) If not, the port
is just the duck type that your adapters conform to and that your core application
expects—the function and method names in use, and their argument names and types.

Concretely, in this chapter, `AbstractRepository` is the port, and
`SqlAlchemyRepository` and `FakeRepository` are the adapters.



=== Wrap-Up

Bearing the Rich Hickey quote in mind, in each chapter we
summarize the costs and benefits((("Repository pattern", "and persistence ignorance, trade-offs")))((("persistence ignorance", "trade-offs"))) of each architectural pattern we introduce.
We want to be clear that we're not saying every single application needs
to be built this way; only sometimes does the complexity of the app and domain
make it worth investing the time and effort in adding these extra layers of
indirection. 

With that in mind, <<chapter_02_repository_tradeoffs>> shows
some of the pros and cons of the Repository pattern and our persistence-ignorant
model.

////
[SG] is it worth mentioning that the repository is specifically intended for add and get
of our domain model objects, rather than something used to add and get any old data
which you might call a DAO. Repository is more close to the business domain.
////

[[chapter_02_repository_tradeoffs]]
[options="header"]
.Repository pattern and persistence ignorance: the trade-offs
|===
|Pros|Cons
a|
* We have a simple interface between persistent storage and our domain model.

* It's easy to make a fake version of the repository for unit testing, or to
  swap out different storage solutions, because we've fully decoupled the model
  from infrastructure concerns.

* Writing the domain model before thinking about persistence helps us focus on
  the business problem at hand. If we ever want to radically change our approach,
  we can do that in our model, without needing to worry about foreign keys
  or migrations until later.

* Our database schema is really simple because we have complete control over
  how we map our objects to tables.

a|
* An ORM already buys you some decoupling. Changing foreign keys might be hard,
  but it should be pretty easy to swap between MySQL and Postgres if you
  ever need to.

////
[KP] I always found this benefit of ORMs rather weak. In the rare cases when I
actually had to switch DB engines, the payoff was high enough to justify some
additional work. Also, if you are using "interesting" DB features (say: special
Postgres fields) you usually lose the portability.
////


* Maintaining ORM mappings by hand requires extra work and extra code.

* Any extra layer of indirection always increases maintenance costs and
  adds a "WTF factor" for Python programmers who've never seen the Repository pattern
  before.
|===

<<domain_model_tradeoffs_diagram>> shows the basic thesis: yes, for simple
cases, a decoupled domain model is harder work than a simple ORM/ActiveRecord
pattern.footnote:[Diagram inspired by a post called
https://oreil.ly/fQXkP["Global Complexity, Local Simplicity"] by Rob Vens.]

TIP: If your app is just a simple CRUD (create-read-update-delete) wrapper
    around a database, then you don't need a domain model or a repository.

But the more complex the domain, the more an investment in freeing
yourself from ((("&quot;Global Complexity, Local Simplicity&quot; post", primary-sortas="Global")))((("Vens, Rob")))((("domain model", "trade-offs as a diagram")))infrastructure concerns will pay off in terms of the ease of
making changes.

----

Our example code isn't complex enough to give more than a hint of what
the right-hand side of the graph looks like, but the hints are there.
Imagine, for example, if we decide one day that we want to change allocations
to live on the `OrderLine` instead of on the `Batch` object: if we were using
Django, say, we'd have to define and think through the database migration
before we could run any tests. As it is, because our model is just plain
old Python objects, we can change a `set()` to being a new attribute, without
needing to think about the database until later.

.Repository Pattern Recap
*****************************************************************
Apply dependency inversion to your ORM::
    Our domain model should be free of infrastructure concerns,
    so your ORM should import your model, and not the other way
    around.((("Repository pattern", "recap of important points")))

The Repository pattern is a simple abstraction around permanent storage::
    The repository gives you the illusion of a collection of in-memory
    objects. It makes it easy to create a `FakeRepository` for
    testing and to swap fundamental details of your
    infrastructure without disrupting your core application. See
    <<appendix_csvs>> for an example.
*****************************************************************

You'll be wondering, how do we instantiate these repositories, fake or
real? What will our Flask app actually look like? You'll find out in the next
exciting installment, <<chapter_04_service_layer,the Service Layer pattern>>.

But first, a brief digression.((("Repository pattern", startref="ix_Repo")))
