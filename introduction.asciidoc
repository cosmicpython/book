== Introduction: Why Do Our Designs Go Wrong?

What comes to mind when you hear the word _chaos?_ Perhaps you think of a noisy
stock exchange, or your kitchen in the morning - everything confused and
jumbled. When you think of the word _order_ perhaps you think of an empty room,
serene and calm. For scientists, though, chaos is characterized by homogeneity
(sameness), and order by complexity (difference).

[SG] Found previous paragraph a bit confusing.  It seems to suggest that a scientist would
say that a noisy stock exchange is ordered. I feel like you want to talk about Entropy
but do not want to go down that rabbit hole.

For example, a well-tended garden is a highly ordered system. Gardeners define
boundaries with paths and fences, and they mark out flower beds or vegetable
patches. Over time, the garden evolves, growing richer and thicker, but without
deliberate effort, the garden will run wild. Weeds and grasses will choke out
other plants, covering over the paths until, eventually, every part looks the
same again - wild and unmanaged.

Software systems, too, tend toward chaos. When we first start building a new
system, we have grand ideas that our code will be clean and well-ordered, but
over time we find that it gathers cruft and edge cases, and ends up a confusing
morass of manager classes and utils modules. We find that our sensibly layered
architecture has collapsed into itself like an over-soggy trifle. Chaotic
software systems are characterised by a sameness of function: API handlers that
have domain knowledge, and send emails and perform logging; "business logic"
classes that perform no calculations but do perform IO; and everything coupled
to everything else so that changing any part of the system becomes fraught with
danger. This is so common that software engineers have their own term for
chaos: The Big Ball of Mud anti-pattern (<<bbom_image>>)footnote:[Big Ball of Mud illustration from https://thedailywtf.com/articles/Enterprise-Dependency-Big-Ball-of-Yarn].

Big ball of mud is the natural state of software in the same way that wilderness
is the natural state of your garden. It takes energy and direction to
prevent the collapse. Fortunately, the techniques to avoid creating a big ball
of mud aren't complex.

=== Encapsulation and Abstractions

The term _encapsulation_ covers two closely related ideas: simplifying
behavior, and hiding data. In this book, when we say "encapsulation" we're
using the first sense. We encapsulate behavior by identifying a task
that needs to be done in our code, and giving that task to a well defined
object or function; we call that an _abstraction_.

Take a look at the following two snippets of Python code, <<urllib_example>> and
<<requests_example>>:


[[urllib_example]]
.Do a search with urllib
====
[source,python]
----
import json
from urllib.request import urlopen
from urllib.parse import urlencode

params = dict(q='Sausages', format='json')
handle = urlopen('http://api.duckduckgo.com' + '?' + urlencode(params))
raw_text = handle.read().decode('utf8')
parsed = json.loads(raw_text)

results = parsed['RelatedTopics']
for r in results:
    if 'Text' in r:
        print(r['FirstURL'] + ' - ' + r['Text'])
----
====

[[requests_example]]
.Do a search with requests
====
[source,python]
----
import requests

params = dict(q='Sausages', format='json')
parsed = requests.get('http://api.duckduckgo.com/', params=params).json()

results = parsed['RelatedTopics']
for r in results:
    if 'Text' in r:
        print(r['FirstURL'] + ' - ' + r['Text'])
----
====

Both of these code listings do the same thing: they submit form-encoded values
to a URL in order to use a search engine API. But the second is simpler to read
and understand because it operates at a higher level of abstraction.

We can take this one step further still by identifying and naming the task we
want the code to perform for us, and use an even higher-level abstraction to make
it explicit:

[[ddg_example]]
.Do a search with the duckduckgo module
====
[source,python]
----
import duckduckgo
for r in duckduckgo.query('Sausages').results:
    print(r.url + ' - ' + r.text)
----
====

Encapsulating behavior using abstractions is a powerful tool for making
our code more expressive, more testable, and easier to maintain.


NOTE: This approach is inspired by the OO practice of
    http://www.wirfs-brock.com/Design.html[responsibility-driven design].
    which would use the words _roles_ and _responsibilities_ rather than tasks.
    The main point is to think about code in terms of behavior, rather than
    in terms of data or algorithms.  If you've come across CRC cards, they're
    driving at the same thing.

In a traditional OO language you might use an abstract base class or an
interface to define an abstraction.  In Python you can (and we sometimes do)
use ABCs, but you can also rely on duck typing.  The abstraction can just mean,
"the public API of the thing you're using"; a function name plus some
arguments, for example.

Most of the patterns in this book involve choosing an abstraction, so you'll
see plenty of examples in each chapter.  We also talk about some general
heuristics for choosing abstractions in <<chapter_03_abstractions>>.


=== Layering

Encapsulation and abstraction help us by hiding details and protecting the
consistency of our data, but we also need to pay attention to the interactions
between our objects and functions. When one function, module or object uses
another, we say that the one _depends on_ the other. These dependencies form a
kind of network or graph.

In a big ball of mud, the dependencies are out of control. Changing one node of
the graph becomes difficult because it has the potential to affect many other
parts of the system. Layered architectures are one way of tackling this
problem. In a layered architecture, we divide our code into discrete categories
or roles and we introduce rules about which categories of code can call each
other.

For example most people are familiar with the three layered architecture (see
<<layered_architecture1>>):

// [SG] do you really mean layers and not tiers, maybe we do not care.

Layered architecture is perhaps the most common pattern for building business
software. In this model we have user-interface components, which could be a web
page, or an API, or a command line; these user-interface components communicate
with a business logic layer that contains our business rules and our workflows;
and finally we have a data layer that's responsible for storing and retrieving
data.

For the rest of this book, we're going to be systematically turning this
model inside out by obeying one simple principle.


[[dip]]
=== The Dependency Inversion Principle

////
TODO:
You can explain DI

[SG] DI? Is this still Dependency Inversion?  Not Dependency Injection right?

more easily once you have introduced layers by noting that
as we depend downwards, it becomes impossible to use something from a higher
layer. To correct this, you need to create an interface in your layer, and have
something in the higher layer implement that. The DI is when you provide the
concrete dependency when calling the lower layer. Hexagonal architectures with
their ‘depend inwards’ model are even clearer here, because for the port layer
to do I/O it must depend on the adapter layer above it, which it can’t do, so
it creates a DAO abstraction, depends on that, and has that implemented in the
adapter layer.

https://github.com/cosmicpython/book/issues/49
////

You might be familiar with the dependency inversion principle already, because
it's the D in the SOLIDfootnote:[Uncle Bob's five principles of object-oriented
design: Single responsibility, Open for extension but
closed for modification, Liskov substitution, Interface segregation, and
Dependency Inversion.  There's a good overview, with examples, at
https://scotch.io/bar-talk/s-o-l-i-d-the-first-five-principles-of-object-oriented-design]
mnemonic.

Unfortunately we can't illustrate the DIP using three tiny code listings like
we did for encapsulation, but since the whole of Part 1 is essentially a worked
example of implementing the DIP throughout an application, hopefully you'll get
your fill of concrete examples from those.

In the meantime, we can talk about the formal definition of the DIP, which is:

// [SG] reference?

1.  High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should
    depend on abstractions.

2.  Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on
    abstractions.

But what does this mean? Let's take it bit by bit.

_High level modules_ are the code that your organisation really cares about.
Perhaps you work for a pharmaceutical company, and your high-level modules deal
with patients and trials. Perhaps you work for a bank, and your high level
modules manage trades and exchanges. The high-level modules of a software
system are the functions, classes, and packages that deal with our real world
concepts.

By contrast, _low-level modules_ are the code that your organisation doesn't
care about. It's unlikely that your HR department gets excited about file
systems, or network sockets. It's not often that you can discuss SMTP, or HTTP,
or AMQP with your finance team. For our non-technical stakeholders, these
low-level concepts aren't interesting or relevant. All they care about is
whether the high-level concepts work correctly. If payroll runs on time, your
business is unlikely to care whether that's a cron job or a transient function
running on Kubernetes.

_Depends on_ doesn't mean "imports" or "calls", necessarily, but more a more
general idea that one module "knows about" or "needs" another module.

And we've mentioned _abstractions_ already: they're simplified interfaces that
encapsulate some behavior, in the way that our duckduckgo module encapsulated a
search engine's API.

So the first part of the DIP says that our business code shouldn't depend on
technical details; instead they should both use abstractions.


[quote,David Wheeler]
____
All problems in computer science can be solved by adding another level of
indirection
____

Why? Broadly, because we want to be able to change them independently of each
other.  High-level modules should be easy to change in response to business
need.  Low-level modules (details) are often, in practice, harder to
change: think about refactoring to change a function name vs defining, testing
and deploying a database migration to change a column name.  We don't
want business logic changes to be slowed down because they are closely coupled
to low-level infrastructure details.  But, similarly, it is important to _be
able_ to change your infrastructure details when you need to (think about
sharding a database, for example), without needing to make changes to your
business layer.  Adding an abstraction in between them (the famous extra
layer of indirection) allows the two to change (more) independently of each
other.

The second part is even more mysterious. "Abstractions should not depend on
details" seems clear enough, but "Details should depend on abstractions" is
hard to imagine. How can we have an abstraction that doesn't depend on the
details it's abstracting?  By the time we get to <<chapter_04_service_layer>>,
we'll have a concrete example which should make this all a bit more clear.


=== A Place for all our Business Logic: the Domain Model

But before we can turn our three-layered architecture inside out, we need to
talk more about that middle layer, the "high-level modules", the business
logic. One of the most common reasons that our designs go wrong is that
business logic becomes spread out throughout the layers of our application,
hard to identify, understand and change.

In <<chapter_01_domain_model>>, we'll show how to build a business
layer using a _Domain Model_, and the rest of the patterns in Part 1 will show
how we can keep the domain model easy to change and free of low-level concerns,
by choosing the right abstractions and continuously applying the DIP.
