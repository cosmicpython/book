=== Why Do Our Designs Go Wrong?

What comes to mind when you hear the word _chaos?_ Perhaps you think of a noisy
stock exchange, or your kitchen in the morning--everything confused and
jumbled. When you think of the word _order_, perhaps you think of an empty room,
serene and calm. For scientists, though, chaos is characterized by homogeneity
(sameness), and order by complexity (difference).

IDEA [SG] Found previous paragraph a bit confusing.  It seems to suggest that a
scientist would say that a noisy stock exchange is ordered. I feel like you
want to talk about Entropy but do not want to go down that rabbit hole.

For example, a well-tended garden is a highly ordered system. Gardeners define
boundaries with paths and fences, and they mark out flower beds or vegetable
patches. Over time, the garden evolves, growing richer and thicker; but without
deliberate effort, the garden will run wild. Weeds and grasses will choke out
other plants, covering over the paths, until eventually every part looks the
same again--wild and unmanaged.

Software systems, too, tend toward chaos. When we first start building a new
system, we have grand ideas that our code will be clean and well ordered, but
over time we find that it gathers cruft and edge cases and ends up a confusing
morass of manager classes and util modules. We find that our sensibly layered
architecture has collapsed into itself like an oversoggy trifle. Chaotic
software systems are characterized by a sameness of function: API handlers that
have domain knowledge and send email and perform logging; "business logic"
classes that perform no calculations but do perform I/O; and everything coupled
to everything else so that changing any part of the system becomes fraught with
danger. This is so common that software engineers have their own term for
chaos: the Big Ball of Mud antipattern (<<bbom_image>>).

TIP: A big ball of mud is the natural state of software in the same way that wilderness
    is the natural state of your garden. It takes energy and direction to
    prevent the collapse.

Fortunately, the techniques to avoid creating a big ball of mud aren't complex.

=== Encapsulation and Abstractions

Encapsulation and abstraction are tools that we all instinctively reach for
as programmers, even if we don't all use these exact words.  Allow us to dwell
on them for a moment, since they are a recurring background theme of the book.

The term _encapsulation_ covers two closely related ideas: simplifying
behavior and hiding data. In this discussion, we're using the first sense. We
encapsulate behavior by identifying a task that needs to be done in our code
and giving that task to a well-defined object or function. We call that object or function an
_abstraction_.

//DS: not sure I agree with this definition.  more about establishing boundaries?

Take a look at the following two snippets of Python code:


[[urllib_example]]
.Do a search with urllib
====
[source,python]
----
import json
from urllib.request import urlopen
from urllib.parse import urlencode

params = dict(q='Sausages', format='json')
handle = urlopen('http://api.duckduckgo.com' + '?' + urlencode(params))
raw_text = handle.read().decode('utf8')
parsed = json.loads(raw_text)

results = parsed['RelatedTopics']
for r in results:
    if 'Text' in r:
        print(r['FirstURL'] + ' - ' + r['Text'])
----
====

[[requests_example]]
.Do a search with requests
====
[source,python]
----
import requests

params = dict(q='Sausages', format='json')
parsed = requests.get('http://api.duckduckgo.com/', params=params).json()

results = parsed['RelatedTopics']
for r in results:
    if 'Text' in r:
        print(r['FirstURL'] + ' - ' + r['Text'])
----
====

Both code listings do the same thing: they submit form-encoded values
to a URL in order to use a search engine API. But the second is simpler to read
and understand because it operates at a higher level of abstraction.

We can take this one step further still by identifying and naming the task we
want the code to perform for us and using an even higher-level abstraction to make
it explicit:

[[ddg_example]]
.Do a search with the duckduckgo client library
====
[source,python]
----
import duckduckpy
for r in duckduckpy.query('Sausages').related_topics:
    print(r.first_url, ' - ', r.text)
----
====

Encapsulating behavior by using abstractions is a powerful tool for making
code more expressive, more testable, and easier to maintain.

NOTE: In the literature of the object-oriented (OO) world, one of the classic
    characterizations of this approach is called
    http://www.wirfs-brock.com/Design.html[_responsibility-driven design_];
    it uses the words _roles_ and _responsibilities_ rather than _tasks_.
    The main point is to think about code in terms of behavior, rather than
    in terms of data or algorithms.footnote:[If you've come across
    class-responsibility-collaborator (CRC) cards, they're
    driving at the same thing: thinking about _responsibilities_ helps you decide how to split things up.]

.Abstractions and ABCs
*******************************************************************************
In a traditional OO language like Java or C#, you might use an abstract base
class (ABC) or an interface to define an abstraction. In Python you can (and we
sometimes do) use ABCs, but you can also happily rely on duck typing.

The abstraction can just mean "the public API of the thing you're using"—a
function name plus some arguments, for example.
*******************************************************************************

Most of the patterns in this book involve choosing an abstraction, so you'll
see plenty of examples in each chapter. In addition,
<<chapter_03_abstractions>> specifically discusses some general heuristics
for choosing abstractions.


=== Layering

Encapsulation and abstraction help us by hiding details and protecting the
consistency of our data, but we also need to pay attention to the interactions
between our objects and functions. When one function, module, or object uses
another, we say that the one _depends on_ the other. These dependencies form a
kind of network or graph.

In a big ball of mud, the dependencies are out of control (as you saw in
<<bbom_image>>). Changing one node of the graph becomes difficult because it
has the potential to affect many other parts of the system. Layered
architectures are one way of tackling this problem. In a layered architecture,
we divide our code into discrete categories or roles, and we introduce rules
about which categories of code can call each other.

One of the most common examples is the _three-layered architecture_ shown in
<<layered_architecture1>>.

Layered architecture is perhaps the most common pattern for building business
software. In this model we have user-interface components, which could be a web
page, an API, or a command line; these user-interface components communicate
with a business logic layer that contains our business rules and our workflows;
and finally, we have a database layer that's responsible for storing and retrieving
data.

For the rest of this book, we're going to be systematically turning this
model inside out by obeying one simple principle.


[[dip]]
=== The Dependency Inversion Principle

You might be familiar with the _dependency inversion principle_ (DIP) already, because
it's the _D_ in SOLID.footnote:[SOLID is an acronym for Robert C. Martin's five principles of object-oriented
design: single responsibility, open for extension but
closed for modification, Liskov substitution, interface segregation, and
dependency inversion. See https://oreil.ly/UFM7U["S.O.L.I.D: The First 5 Principles of Object-Oriented Design"] by Samuel Oloruntoba.]

Unfortunately, we can't illustrate the DIP by using three tiny code listings as
we did for encapsulation. However, the whole of <<part1>> is essentially a worked
example of implementing the DIP throughout an application, so you'll get
your fill of concrete examples.

In the meantime, we can talk about DIP's formal definition:

// [SG] reference?

1.  High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should
    depend on abstractions.

2.  Abstractions should not depend on details. Instead, details should depend on
    abstractions.

But what does this mean? Let's take it bit by bit.

_High-level modules_ are the code that your organization really cares about.
Perhaps you work for a pharmaceutical company, and your high-level modules deal
with patients and trials. Perhaps you work for a bank, and your high-level
modules manage trades and exchanges. The high-level modules of a software
system are the functions, classes, and packages that deal with our real-world
concepts.

By contrast, _low-level modules_ are the code that your organization doesn't
care about. It's unlikely that your HR department gets excited about filesystems or network sockets. It's not often that you discuss SMTP, HTTP,
or AMQP with your finance team. For our nontechnical stakeholders, these
low-level concepts aren't interesting or relevant. All they care about is
whether the high-level concepts work correctly. If payroll runs on time, your
business is unlikely to care whether that's a cron job or a transient function
running on Kubernetes.

_Depends on_ doesn't mean _imports_ or _calls_, necessarily, but rather a more
general idea that one module _knows about_ or _needs_ another module.

And we've mentioned _abstractions_ already: they're simplified interfaces that
encapsulate behavior, in the way that our duckduckgo module encapsulated a
search engine's API.

[quote,David Wheeler]
____
All problems in computer science can be solved by adding another level of
indirection.
____

So the first part of the DIP says that our business code shouldn't depend on
technical details; instead, both should use abstractions.

Why? Broadly, because we want to be able to change them independently of each
other. High-level modules should be easy to change in response to business
needs. Low-level modules (details) are often, in practice, harder to
change: think about refactoring to change a function name versus defining, testing,
and deploying a database migration to change a column name. We don't
want business logic changes to slow down because they are closely coupled
to low-level infrastructure details. But, similarly, it is important to _be
able_ to change your infrastructure details when you need to (think about
sharding a database, for example), without needing to make changes to your
business layer. Adding an abstraction between them (the famous extra
layer of indirection) allows the two to change (more) independently of each
other.

The second part is even more mysterious. "Abstractions should not depend on
details" seems clear enough, but "Details should depend on abstractions" is
hard to imagine. How can we have an abstraction that doesn't depend on the
details it's abstracting? By the time we get to <<chapter_04_service_layer>>,
we'll have a concrete example that should make this all a bit clearer.


=== A Place for All Our Business Logic: The Domain Model

But before we can turn our three-layered architecture inside out, we need to
talk more about that middle layer: the high-level modules or business
logic. One of the most common reasons that our designs go wrong is that
business logic becomes spread throughout the layers of our application,
making it hard to identify, understand, and change.

<<chapter_01_domain_model>> shows how to build a business
layer with a _Domain Model_ pattern. The rest of the patterns in <<part1>> show
how we can keep the domain model easy to change and free of low-level concerns
by choosing the right abstractions and continuously applying the DIP.
