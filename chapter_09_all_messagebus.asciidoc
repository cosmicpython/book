== Going to Town on the Message Bus

In this chapter, we'll start to make events more fundamental to the internal
structure of our application.((("events and the message bus", "transforming our app into message processor", id="ix_evntMBMP")))((("message bus", "before, message buse as optional add-on"))) We'll move from the current state in
<<maps_chapter_08_before>>, where events are an optional
side effect...

...to the situation in <<map_chapter_08_after>>, where
everything goes via the message bus, and our app has been transformed
fundamentally into a message processor.((("message bus", "now the main entrypoint to service layer")))((("service layer", "message bus as main entrypoint")))

=== A New Requirement Leads Us to a New Architecture

Rich Hickey talks about _situated software,_ meaning software that runs for
extended periods of time, managing a real-world process. ((("situated software")))((("events and the message bus", "transforming our app into message processor", "new requirement and new architecture")))Examples include
warehouse-management systems, logistics schedulers, and payroll systems.

This software is tricky to write because unexpected things happen all the time
in the real world of physical objects and unreliable humans. For example:

* During a stock-take, we discover that three pass:[<code>SPRINGY-MATTRESS</code>]es have been
  water damaged by a leaky roof.
* A consignment of pass:[<code>RELIABLE-FORK</code>]s is missing the required documentation and is
  held in customs for several weeks. Three pass:[<code>RELIABLE-FORK</code>]s subsequently fail safety
  testing and are destroyed.
* A global shortage of sequins means we're unable to manufacture our next batch
  of pass:[<code>SPARKLY-BOOKCASE</code>].

In these types of situations, we learn about the need to change batch quantities
when they're already in the system.((("batches", "batch quantities changed means deallocate and reallocate"))) Perhaps someone made a mistake on the number
in the manifest, or perhaps some sofas fell off a truck. Following a
conversation with the business,footnote:[
Event-based modeling is so popular that a practice((("event storming"))) called _event storming_ has
been developed for facilitating event-based requirements gathering and domain
model elaboration.] we model the situation as in
<<batch_changed_events_flow_diagram>>.

----

An event we'll call `BatchQuantityChanged` should lead us to change the
quantity on the batch, yes, but also to apply a _business rule_: if the new
quantity drops to less than the total already allocated, we need to
_deallocate_  those orders from that batch. Then each one will require
a new allocation, which we can capture as an event called `AllocationRequired`.

Perhaps you're already anticipating that our internal message bus and events can
help implement this requirement. We could define a service called
`change_batch_quantity` that knows how to adjust batch quantities and also how
to _deallocate_ any excess order lines, and then each deallocation can emit an
`AllocationRequired` event that can be forwarded to the existing `allocate`
service, in separate transactions. Once again, our message bus helps us to
enforce the single responsibility principle, and it allows us to make choices about
transactions and data integrity.

[role="pagebreak-before less_space"]
==== Imagining an Architecture Change: Everything Will Be an pass:[<span class="keep-together">Event Handler</span>]

But before we jump in, think about where we're headed. ((("events and the message bus", "transforming our app into message processor", "imagined architecture, everything will be an event handler")))((("event handlers", "imagined architecture in which everything is an event handler"))) There are two
kinds of flows through our system:

* API calls that are handled by a service-layer function

* Internal events (which might be raised as a side effect of a service-layer function)
  and their handlers (which in turn call service-layer functions)

Wouldn't it be easier if everything was an event handler?  If we rethink our API
calls as capturing events, the service-layer functions can be event handlers
too, and we no longer need ((("service functions", "making them event handlers")))to make a distinction between internal and external
event handlers:

* `services.allocate()` could be the handler for an
  `AllocationRequired` event and could emit `Allocated` events as its output.

* `services.add_batch()` could((("BatchCreated event", "services.add_batch as handler for"))) be the handler for a `BatchCreated`
  event.footnote:[If you've done a bit of reading about event-driven
    architectures, you may be thinking, "Some of these events sound more like
    commands!" Bear with us! We're trying to introduce one concept at a time.
    In the <<chapter_10_commands,next chapter>>, we'll introduce the distinction
    between commands and events.]

Our new requirement will fit the same pattern:

* An event called `BatchQuantityChanged` can invoke((("BatchQuantityChanged event", "invoking handler change_batch_quantity"))) a handler called
  `change_batch_quantity()`.

* And the new `AllocationRequired` events ((("AllocationRequired event", "passing to services.allocate")))that it may raise can be passed on to
  `services.allocate()` too, so there is no conceptual difference between a
  brand-new allocation coming from the API and a reallocation that's
  internally triggered by a deallocation.


All sound like a bit much? Let's work toward it all gradually.  We'll
follow the
https://oreil.ly/W3RZM[Preparatory
Refactoring] workflow, aka "Make the change easy; then((("preparatory refactoring workflow"))) make the easy change":


1. We refactor our service layer into event handlers. We can
  get used to the idea of events being the way we describe inputs to the
  system. In particular, the existing `services.allocate()` function will
  become the handler for an event called `AllocationRequired`.

2. We build an end-to-end test that puts `BatchQuantityChanged` events
  into the system and looks for `Allocated` events coming out.

3. Our implementation will conceptually be very simple: a new
  handler for `BatchQuantityChanged` events, whose implementation will emit
  `AllocationRequired` events, which in turn will be handled by the exact same
  handler for allocations that the API uses.


Along the way, we'll make a small tweak to the message bus and UoW, moving the
responsibility for putting new events on the message bus into the message bus itself.


=== Refactoring Service Functions to Message Handlers

We start by defining the two events that ((("service functions", "refactoring to message handlers")))((("events and the message bus", "transforming our app into message processor", "refactoring service functions to message handlers")))((("BatchCreated event")))((("AllocationRequired event")))capture our current API inputs—`AllocationRequired` and `BatchCreated`:

    eta: Optional[date] = None

...

@dataclass
class AllocationRequired(Event):
    orderid: str
    sku: str
    qty: int
----
====

Then we rename _services.py_ to _handlers.py_; we add the existing message handler
for `send_out_of_stock_notification`; and most importantly, we change all the
handlers so that they have the same inputs, an event and a UoW:


[[services_to_handlers]]

        ...

        event: events.AllocationRequired, uow: unit_of_work.AbstractUnitOfWork
) -> str:
    line = OrderLine(event.orderid, event.sku, event.qty)

        event: events.OutOfStock, uow: unit_of_work.AbstractUnitOfWork,
):
    email.send(
        'stock@made.com',
        f'Out of stock for {event.sku}',
    )

Along the way, we've made our service-layer's API more structured and more consistent. It was a scattering of
primitives, and now it uses well-defined objects (see the following sidebar).

[role="nobreakinside less_space"]
.From Domain Objects, via Primitive Obsession, to pass:[<span class="keep-together">Events as an Interface</span>]
*******************************************************************************
Some of you may remember <<primitive_obsession>>, in which we changed our service-layer API
from being in terms of domain objects to primitives. And now we're moving
back, but to different objects? ((("service layer", "from domain objects to primitives to events as interface"))) What gives?

In OO circles, people ((("primitive obsession")))talk about _primitive obsession_ as an anti-pattern: avoid
primitives in public APIs, and instead wrap them with custom value classes, they
would say. In the Python world, a lot of people would be quite skeptical of
that as a rule of thumb. When mindlessly applied, it's certainly a recipe for
unnecessary complexity. So that's not what we're doing per se.

The move from domain objects to((("primitives", "moving from domain objects to, in service layer"))) primitives bought us a nice bit of decoupling:
our client code was no longer coupled directly to the domain, so the service
layer could present an API that stays the same even if we decide to make changes
to our model, and vice versa.

So have we gone backward? Well, our core domain model objects are still free to
vary, but instead we've coupled the external world to our event classes.
They're part of the domain too, but the hope is that they vary less often, so
they're a sensible artifact to couple on.

And what have we bought ourselves? Now, when invoking a use case in our application,
we no longer need to remember a particular combination of primitives, but just a single
event class that represents the input to our application. That's conceptually
quite nice. On top of that, as you'll see in <<appendix_validation>>, those
event classes can be a nice place to do some input validation.
*******************************************************************************


==== The Message Bus Now Collects Events from the UoW

Our event handlers now need a UoW.((("message bus", "now collecting events from UoW")))((("Unit of Work pattern", "message bus now collecting events from UoW"))) In addition, as our message bus becomes
more central to our application, it makes sense to put it explicitly in charge of
collecting and processing new events. ((("dependencies", "UoW no longer dependent on message bus")))There was a bit of a circular dependency
between the UoW and message bus until now, so this will make it one-way:


[[handle_has_uow_and_queue]]
.Handle takes a UoW and manages a queue (src/allocation/service_layer/messagebus.py)
====

        for handler in HANDLERS[type(event)]:  #<3>
            handler(event, uow=uow)  #<4>
            queue.extend(uow.collect_new_events())  #<5>
----
====

<1> The message bus now gets passed the UoW each time it starts up.
<2> When we begin handling our first event, we start a queue.
<3> We pop events from the front of the queue and invoke their handlers (the
    pass:[<span class="keep-together"><code>HANDLERS</code></span>] dict hasn't changed; it still maps event types to handler functions).
<4> The message bus passes the UoW down to each handler.
<5> After each handler finishes, we collect any new events that have been
    generated and add them to the queue.

In _unit_of_work.py_, `publish_events()` becomes a less active method,
`collect_new_events()`:

And we should be back to a fully functional application, but one that's now
fully event-driven:

* What used to be service-layer functions are now event handlers.

* That makes them the same as the functions we invoke for handling internal events raised by
  our domain model.

* We use events as our data structure for capturing inputs to the system,
  as well as for handing off of internal work packages.

* The entire app is now best described as a message processor, or an event processor
  if you prefer.  We'll talk about the distinction in the
  <<chapter_10_commands, next chapter>>.



=== Implementing Our New Requirement

We're done with our refactoring phase. ((("events and the message bus", "transforming our app into message processor", "implementing the new requirement", id="ix_evntMBMPreq")))Let's see if we really have "made the
change easy."  Let's implement our new requirement, shown in <<reallocation_sequence_diagram>>: we'll receive as our
inputs some new `BatchQuantityChanged` events and pass them to a handler, which in
turn might emit some `AllocationRequired` events, and those in turn will go
back to our existing handler for allocation, to be reallocated.((("reallocation", "sequence diagram for flow")))

    but the second one does not. You'll need to think about whether this is acceptable,
    and whether you need to notice when it happens and do something about it.
    See <<footguns>> for more discussion.



==== Our New Event

The event that tells us a batch quantity has changed is simple; it just
needs a batch((("BatchQuantityChanged event", "implementing"))) reference and a new quantity:

        )
        [batch] = uow.products.get(sku="ADORABLE-SETTEE").batches
        assert batch.available_quantity == 100  #<1>

        messagebus.handle(events.BatchQuantityChanged("batch1", 50), uow)

        assert batch.available_quantity == 50  #<1>


    def test_reallocates_if_necessary(self):
        uow = FakeUnitOfWork()
        event_history = [
            events.BatchCreated("batch1", "INDIFFERENT-TABLE", 50, None),
            events.BatchCreated("batch2", "INDIFFERENT-TABLE", 50, date.today()),
            events.AllocationRequired("order1", "INDIFFERENT-TABLE", 20),
            events.AllocationRequired("order2", "INDIFFERENT-TABLE", 20),
        ]
        for e in event_history:

        [batch1, batch2] = uow.products.get(sku="INDIFFERENT-TABLE").batches
        assert batch1.available_quantity == 10
        assert batch2.available_quantity == 50

        messagebus.handle(events.BatchQuantityChanged("batch1", 25), uow)

        # order1 or order2 will be deallocated, so we'll have 25 - 20
        assert batch1.available_quantity == 5  #<2>
        # and 20 will be reallocated to the next batch
        assert batch2.available_quantity == 30  #<2>

====

<1> The simple case would be trivially easy to implement; we just
    modify a quantity.

<2> But if we try to change the quantity to less than
    has been allocated, we'll need to deallocate at least one order,
    and we expect to reallocate it to a new batch.

NOTE: We're adding a query to our repository to make this use case easier to
implement.((("aggregates", "query on repository returning single aggregate"))) So long as our query is returning a single aggregate, we're not
bending any rules. If you find yourself writing complex queries on your
repositories, you might want to consider a different design. Methods like `get_most_popular_products` or `find_products_by_order_id` in particular would
definitely trigger our spidey sense. <<chapter_11_external_events>> and the <<epilogue_1_how_to_get_there_from_here, epilogue>> have some tips on managing complex queries.

==== A New Method on the Domain Model

We add the new method to the model, which does the quantity change and
deallocation(s) inline and publishes a new event.((("domain model", "new method on, change_batch_quantity")))  We also modify the existing
allocate function to publish an event:


[[change_batch_model_layer]]
.Our model evolves to capture the new requirement (src/allocation/domain/model.py)
====
[source,python]
----
class Product:
    ...

    def change_batch_quantity(self, ref: str, qty: int):
        batch = next(b for b in self.batches if b.reference == ref)
        batch._purchased_quantity = qty
        while batch.available_quantity < 0:
            line = batch.deallocate_one()
            self.events.append(
                events.AllocationRequired(line.orderid, line.sku, line.qty)
            )
...

class Batch:
    ...

    def deallocate_one(self) -> OrderLine:
        return self._allocations.pop()
----
====

We wire ((("message bus", "wiring up new event handlers to")))up our new handler:


[[full_messagebus]]
.The message bus grows (src/allocation/service_layer/messagebus.py)
====
[source,python]
----
HANDLERS = {
    events.BatchCreated: [handlers.add_batch],
    events.BatchQuantityChanged: [handlers.change_batch_quantity],
    events.AllocationRequired: [handlers.allocate],
    events.OutOfStock: [handlers.send_out_of_stock_notification],

}  # type: Dict[Type[events.Event], List[Callable]]
----
====

And our new requirement is fully implemented.

[[fake_message_bus]]
=== Optionally: Unit Testing Event Handlers in Isolation with a Fake Message Bus

Our main test((("events and the message bus", "transforming our app into message processor", "unit testing event handlers with fake message bus")))((("testing", "tests written in terms of events", "unit testing event handlers with fake message bus")))((("message bus", "unit testing event handlers with fake message bus"))) for the reallocation workflow is _edge-to-edge_
(see the example code in <<test-driving-ch9>>). It uses
the real message bus, and it tests the whole flow, where the `BatchQuantityChanged`
event handler triggers deallocation, and emits new `AllocationRequired` events, which in
turn are handled by their own handlers. One test covers a chain of multiple
events and handlers.

Depending on the complexity of your chain of events, you may decide that you
want to test some handlers in isolation from one another. You can do this
using a "fake" message bus.

In our case, we actually intervene by ((("Unit of Work pattern", "fake message bus implemented in UoW")))modifying the `publish_events()` method
on `FakeUnitOfWork` and decoupling it from the real message bus, instead making
it record what events it sees:


[[fake_messagebus]]
.Fake message bus implemented in UoW (tests/unit/test_handlers.py)
====
[source,python]
[role="non-head"]
----
class FakeUnitOfWorkWithFakeMessageBus(FakeUnitOfWork):

    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.events_published = []  # type: List[events.Event]

    def publish_events(self):
        for product in self.products.seen:
            while product.events:
                self.events_published.append(product.events.pop(0))
----
====

Now when we invoke `messagebus.handle()` using the `FakeUnitOfWorkWithFakeMessageBus`,
it runs only the handler for that event. So we can write a more isolated unit
test: instead of checking all the side effects, we just check that
`BatchQuantityChanged` leads to `AllocationRequired` if the quantity drops
below the total already ((("reallocation", "testing in isolation using fake message bus")))allocated:

def test_reallocates_if_necessary_isolated():
    uow = FakeUnitOfWorkWithFakeMessageBus()

    # test setup as before
    event_history = [
        events.BatchCreated("batch1", "INDIFFERENT-TABLE", 50, None),
        events.BatchCreated("batch2", "INDIFFERENT-TABLE", 50, date.today()),
        events.AllocationRequired("order1", "INDIFFERENT-TABLE", 20),
        events.AllocationRequired("order2", "INDIFFERENT-TABLE", 20),
    ]
    for e in event_history:
        messagebus.handle(e, uow)
    [batch1, batch2] = uow.products.get(sku="INDIFFERENT-TABLE").batches
    assert batch1.available_quantity == 10
    assert batch2.available_quantity == 50

    messagebus.handle(events.BatchQuantityChanged("batch1", 25), uow)

    # assert on new events emitted rather than downstream side-effects
    [reallocation_event] = uow.events_published
    assert isinstance(reallocation_event, events.AllocationRequired)
    assert reallocation_event.orderid in {'order1', 'order2'}
    assert reallocation_event.sku == 'INDIFFERENT-TABLE'
----
====

Whether you want to do this or not depends on the complexity of your chain of
events. We say, start out with edge-to-edge testing, and resort to
this only if necessary.

.Exercise for the Reader
*******************************************************************************
A great way to force yourself to really understand some code is to refactor it.
In the discussion of testing handlers in isolation, we used something called
`FakeUnitOfWorkWithFakeMessageBus`, which is unnecessarily complicated and
violates the SRP.((("message bus", "abstract message bus and its real and fake versions")))

If we change the message bus to being a class,footnote:[The "simple"
implementation ((("Singleton pattern, messagebus.py implementing")))in this chapter essentially uses the _messagebus.py_ module
itself to implement Singleton Pattern.]
then building a `FakeMessageBus` is more straightforward:

[[abc_for_fake_messagebus]]
.An abstract message bus and its real and fake versions
====
[source,python]
[role="skip"]
----
class AbstractMessageBus:
    HANDLERS: Dict[Type[events.Event], List[Callable]]

    def handle(self, event: events.Event):
        for handler in self.HANDLERS[type(event)]:
            handler(event)


class MessageBus(AbstractMessageBus):
    HANDLERS = {
        events.OutOfStock: [send_out_of_stock_notification],

    }


class FakeMessageBus(messagebus.AbstractMessageBus):
    def __init__(self):
        self.events_published = []  # type: List[events.Event]
        self.handlers = {
            events.OutOfStock: [lambda e: self.events_published.append(e)]
        }
----
====

So jump into the code on
https://github.com/cosmicpython/code/tree/chapter_09_all_messagebus[GitHub] and see if you can get a class-based version
working, and then write a version of `test_reallocates_if_necessary_isolated()`
from earlier.

We use a class-based message bus in <<chapter_13_dependency_injection>>,
if you need more inspiration.

=== What Have We Achieved?

Events are simple dataclasses that define the data structures for inputs,
  and internal messages within our system. This is quite powerful from a DDD
  standpoint, since events often translate really well into business language
  (look up __event storming__ if you haven't already).

Handlers are the way we react to events. They can call down to our
  model or call out to external services.  We can define multiple
  handlers for a single event if we want to. Handlers can also raise other
  events. This allows us to be very granular about what a handler does
  and really stick to the SRP.


=== Why Have We Achieved?

Our ongoing objective with these architectural patterns is to try to have
the complexity of our application grow more slowly than its size.((("message bus", "whole app as, trade-offs")))((("events and the message bus", "transforming our app into message processor", "whole app as message bus, trade-offs")))  When we
go all in on the MessageBus, as always we pay a price in terms of architectural
complexity (see <<chapter_09_all_messagebus_tradeoffs>>), but we buy ourselves a
pattern that can handle almost arbitrarily complex requirements without needing
any further conceptual or architectural change to the way we do things.

Here we've added quite a complicated use case (change quantity, deallocate,
start new transaction, reallocate, publish external notification), but
architecturally, there's been no cost in terms of complexity. We've added new
events, new handlers, and a new external adapter (for email), all of which are
existing categories of _things_ in our architecture that we understand and know
how to reason about, and that are easy to explain to newcomers.  Our moving
parts each have one job, they're connected to each other in well-defined ways,
and there are no unexpected side effects.

.Whole app is a message bus: the trade-offs
|===
|Pros|Cons
a|
* Handlers and services are the same thing, so that's simpler.
* We have a nice data structure for inputs to the system.

a|
* A message bus is still a slightly unpredictable way of doing things from
  a web point of view. You don't know in advance when things are going to end.
* The duplication/maintenance cost of having model objects _and_ events
  now. Adding a field to one usually means adding a field to at least
  one of the others.
|===

Now, you may be wondering, where are those `BatchQuantityChanged` events
going to come from? The answer is revealed in a couple chapters' time.((("events and the message bus", "transforming our app into message processor", startref="ix_evntMBMP")))  But
first, let's talk about <<chapter_10_commands,events versus commands>>.
