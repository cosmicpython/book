[[chapter_04_uow]]
== Unit of Work pattern

In this chapter we'll introduce a final piece of the puzzle that really pulls
the _Repository_ and _Service layer_ patterns together, the _Unit of Work_
pattern.

//TODO: Big Lebowski illustration

In the last chapter, the service layer was tightly coupled to the SQLAlchemy
session object, so we'll fix that.

But we'll also use be giving ourself a tool for explicitly saying that some
work needs to work as an atomic unit.  We either do all of it, or none of it.
An error part of the way along should lead to any interim work being reverted.
In normal life (and for now) that translates straight into a database transaction,
but by giving ourself our own abstraction, we can make it mean more things,
as we'll see when we get to <<chapter_06_events_and_message_bus>>.

What's a nice, Pythonic way of expressing that a block of code should run
as a coherent whole, with some setup at the beginning, and some tidy-up at
the end, some different handling for error and success cases?  Something like
`try/except/finally`?  

A context manager.

=== Test-driving a UoW with integration tests

Here's  a test for a new "unit of work" context manager that allows us to start
a transaction, retrieve and get things from repos, and commit:


[[test_unit_of_work]]
.A basic "roundtrip" test for a unit of work (tests/integration/test_uow.py)
====
[source,python]
----
def insert_batch(session, ref, sku, qty, eta):
    session.execute(
        'INSERT INTO batches (reference, sku, _purchased_quantity, eta)'
        ' VALUES (:ref, :sku, :qty, :eta)',
        dict(ref=ref, sku=sku, qty=qty, eta=eta)
    )

def get_allocated_batch_id(session, orderid, sku):
    [[orderlineid]] = session.execute(
        'SELECT id FROM order_lines WHERE orderid=:orderid AND sku=:sku',
        dict(orderid=orderid, sku=sku)
    )
    [[batchid]] = session.execute(
        'SELECT b.reference FROM allocations JOIN batches AS b ON batch_id = b.id'
        ' WHERE orderline_id=:orderlineid',
        dict(orderlineid=orderlineid)
    )
    return batchid


def test_uow_can_retrieve_a_batch_and_allocate_to_it(session_factory):
    session = session_factory()
    insert_batch(session, 'batch1', 'sku1', 100, None)
    session.commit()

    with unit_of_work.start(session_factory) as uow:  #<1>
        batch = uow.batches.get(reference='batch1')  #<2>
        line = model.OrderLine('o1', 'sku1', 10)
        batch.allocate(line)
        uow.commit()  #<3>

    batchid = get_allocated_batch_id(session, 'o1', 'sku1')
    assert batchid == 'batch1'
----
====

<1> We initialise the unit of work using a starter function,
    and get back a `uow` object to use in our `with` block.

<2> The UoW gives us access to the batches repository via
    `uow.batches`

<3> And we call `commit()` on it when we're done.


=== Unit of Work and its context manager

Here's an implementation:


[[unit_of_work]]
.Basic unit of work context manager  (src/allocation/unit_of_work.py)
====
[source,python]
----
default_session_factory = sessionmaker(bind=create_engine(config.get_postgres_uri()))

@contextmanager  #<1>
def start(session_factory=default_session_factory):
    session = session_factory()
    try:
        yield _UnitOfWork(session)  #<2>
    finally:
        session.rollback()  #<5>


class _UnitOfWork:
    def __init__(self, session):
        self.session = session
        self.batches = repository.BatchRepository(session)  #<3>

    def commit(self):  #<4>
        self.session.commit()
----
====

<1> You can use class-based or generator-based context managers,
    whichever you find more readable and Pythonic.

<2> The context manager provides a `_UnitOfWork` instance, which
    gets used in two ways in our code:

<3> It provides access to the repository(-ies).

<4> And it provides a way to explicitly commit our work

<5> If we don't commit, or if we exit the context manager by raising an error,
    we do a `rollback`. (the rollback has no effect if `commit()` has been
    called.  Read on for more discussion of this).

//TODO: should be DEFAULT_SESSION_FACTORY



=== Fake Unit of Work for testing:

Here's how we use a fake unit of work in our service layer tests


[[fake_unit_of_work]]
.Fake unit of work (tests/unit/test_services.py)
====
[source,python]
----
class FakeUnitOfWork:
    def __init__(self):
        self.batches = FakeRepository()  #<1>
        self.committed = False

    def commit(self):  #<2>
        self.committed = True


def test_add_batch():
    uow = FakeUnitOfWork()
    start_uow = lambda: nullcontext(uow)
    services.add_batch('b1', 'sku1', 100, None, start_uow)
    assert uow.batches.get('b1') is not None
    assert uow.committed


def test_allocate_returns_allocation():
    uow = FakeUnitOfWork()
    start_uow = lambda: nullcontext(uow)
    services.add_batch('b1', 'sku1', 100, None, start_uow)
    result = services.allocate('o1', 'sku1', 10, start_uow)
    assert result == 'b1'
----
====

<1> `FakeUnitOfWork` and `FakeRepository` are tightly coupled,
    just like the real unit of work and repository classes

<2> Notice the similarity with the fake `commit()` function
    from `FakeSession` (which we can now get rid of).  But it's 
    a substantial improvement because we're now faking out
    code that we wrote, rather than 3rd party code.  Some
    people say https://github.com/testdouble/contributing-tests/wiki/Don%27t-mock-what-you-don%27t-own["don't mock what you don't own"].


TIP: See the end of <<chapter_06_events_and_message_bus>> for a few examples
    of how you might use abstract base classes to share code between
    `UnitOfWork` and `FakeUnitOfWork`


=== Using the UoW in the service layer

And here's what our new service layer looks like:


[[service_layer_with_uow]]
.Service layer using UoW (src/allocation/services.py)
====
[source,python]
----
def add_batch(ref: str, sku: str, qty: int, eta: Optional[date], start_uow):
    with start_uow() as uow:
        uow.batches.add(model.Batch(ref, sku, qty, eta))
        uow.commit()


def allocate(orderid: str, sku: str, qty: int, start_uow) -> str:
    line = OrderLine(orderid, sku, qty)
    with start_uow() as uow:
        batches = uow.batches.list()
        if not is_valid_sku(line.sku, batches):
            raise InvalidSku(f'Invalid sku {line.sku}')
        batch = model.allocate(line, batches)
        uow.commit()
    return batch
----
====


=== Explicit tests for commit/rollback behaviour

To convince ourselves that the commit/rollback behaviour works, we wrote
a couple of tests:

[[testing_rollback]]
.Integration tests for rollback behaviour (tests/integration/test_uow.py)
====
[source,python]
----
def test_rolls_back_uncommitted_work_by_default(session_factory):
    with unit_of_work.start(session_factory) as uow:
        insert_batch(uow.session, 'batch1', 'sku1', 100, None)

    new_session = session_factory()
    rows = list(new_session.execute('SELECT * FROM "batches"'))
    assert rows == []


def test_rolls_back_on_error(session_factory):
    class MyException(Exception):
        pass

    with pytest.raises(MyException):
        with unit_of_work.start(session_factory) as uow:
            insert_batch(uow.session, 'batch1', 'sku1', 100, None)
            raise MyException()

    new_session = session_factory()
    rows = list(new_session.execute('SELECT * FROM "batches"'))
    assert rows == []
----
====


=== Explicit vs implicit commits

A brief digression on different ways of implementing the UoW pattern.

We could imagine a slightly different version of the UoW, which commits by default,
and only rolls back if it spots an exception:

[[uow_implicit_commit]]
.A UoW with implicit commit... (src/allocation/unit_of_work.py)
====
[source,python]
[role="skip"]
----
@contextmanager
def start(session_factory=default_session_factory):
    session = session_factory()
    try:
        yield _UnitOfWork(session)
        session.commit()  #<1>
    except:
        session.rollback()  #<2>
    finally:
        session.close()  #<3>
----
====

<1> should we have an implicit commit in the happy path?
<2> and roll back only on exception?
<3> and maybe close sessions too?

It would allow us to save a line of code, and remove the explicit commit from our
client code:

[[add_batch_nocommit]]
.\... would save us a line of code (src/allocation/services.py)
====
[source,python]
[role="skip"]
----
def add_batch(ref: str, sku: str, qty: int, eta: Optional[date], start_uow):
    with start_uow() as uow:
        uow.batches.add(model.Batch(ref, sku, qty, eta))
        # uow.commit()
----
====

This is a judgement call, but we tend to prefer requiring the explicit commit.
"explicit is better than implicit", and all that.

As to the option of using `session.close()`, and our preference of putting the
`rollback` in the `finally` clause, rather than only in the `except` clause,
that's another personal preference, but the "always-rollback` version does feel
easier to understand.  rollback rolls back to the last commit, so either the
user did one, or we blow their changes away.  harsh but simple.  But
`session.close()`, well, we'd have to look up the SQLAlchemy docs to find out
exactly what that does.   And besides, why not leave the session open for the
next time?


=== Examples: Using UoW to group multiple operations into an atomic unit

Here's a few examples showing the unit of work pattern in use.  You can
see how it leads to simple reasoning about what blocks of code happen
together:

==== Example 1: reallocate

Supposing we want to be able to deallocate and then reallocate orders?

[[reallocate]]
.Reallocate service function
====
[source,python]
[role="skip"]
----
def reallocate(line: OrderLine, start_uow) -> str:
    with start_uow() as uow:
        product = uow.products.get(sku=line.sku)
        if product is None:
            raise InvalidSku(f'Invalid sku {line.sku}')
        product.deallocate(line)  #<1>
        product.allocate(line)  #<2>
        uow.commit()
----
====

<1> If `deallocate()` fails, we don't want to do `allocate()`, obviously.
<2> But if `allocate()` fails, we probably don't want to actually commit
    the `deallocate()`, either.


==== Example 2: change batch quantity

Our shipping company gives us a call to say that one of the container doors
opened and half our sofas have fallen into the Indian Ocean.  oops!



[[change_batch_quantity]]
.Change quantity
====
[source,python]
[role="skip"]
----
def change_batch_quantity(batch: Batch, new_qty: int, start_uow):
    with start_uow() as uow:
        product = uow.products.get(sku=batch.sku)
        batch.change_purchased_quantity(new_qty)
        while batch.available_quantity < 0:
            line = batch.deallocate_one()  #<1>
            product.allocate(line)  #<1>
        uow.commit()
----
====

<1> Here we may need to deallocate any number of lines.  If we get a failure
    at any stage, we probably want to commit none of the changes.


=== Tidying up the integration tests

We now have three sets of tests all essentially pointing at the database,
_test_orm.py_, _test_repository.py_ and _test_uow.py_.  Should we throw any
away?

====
[source,text]
[role="tree"]
----
└── tests
    ├── conftest.py
    ├── e2e
    │   └── test_api.py
    ├── integration
    │   ├── test_orm.py
    │   ├── test_repository.py
    │   └── test_uow.py
    ├── pytest.ini
    └── unit
        ├── test_allocate.py
        ├── test_batches.py
        └── test_services.py

----
====

You should always feel free to throw away tests if you feel they're not going to
add value longer term.  We'd say that _test_orm.py_ was primarily a tool to help
us learn SQLAlchemy, so we won't need that long term, especially if the main things
it's doing are covered in _test_repository.py_.  That last you might keep around,
but we could certainly see an argument for just keeping everything at the highest
possible level of abstraction (just as we did for the unit tests).

TODO: expand on this a bit?


=== Wrap-up

Hopefully we've convinced you that the unit of work is a useful pattern, and
hopefully you'll agree that the context manager is a really nice Pythonic way
of visually grouping  code into blocks that we want to happen atomically.

//TODO this wrap-up needs work.

//TODO: discuss the fact that sqla already gives us a unit of work.  check if
//its a context manager. discuss using our own abstraction
