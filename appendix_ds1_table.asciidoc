|===
| Layer | Component | Description

.5+a| Domain 

* Defines the business logic.


| Entity | A domain object whose attributes may change, but that has a recognizable identity over time.

| Value Object | An immutable domain object whose attributes entirely define it. It is fungible with other identical objects.

| Aggregate | Cluster of associated objects that we treat as a unit for the purpose of data changes.

| Event | Represents something that happened, emitted by or stored on domain objects.

| Command | Represents a job the system should perform.

.3+a| Service layer

* Defines the jobs the system should perform and orchestrates different components.  

| Command/Event Handler | Receives a Command or Event and performs what needs to happen.
| Unit of Work | Abstraction around data integrity. Each unit of work represents an atomic update.  Makes repositories available. Tracks new events on retrieved aggregates.
| Message Bus (Internal) | Handles Commands and Events by routing them to the appropriate Handler.

.2+a| Adapters (Secondary)

* Concrete implementations of an interface that goes from our system out
to the outside world / I/O

| Repository | Abstraction around persistent storage. Each Aggregate has its own Repository.
| Event Publisher | Pushes Events onto the external message bus.

.2+a| Entrypoints (Primary adapters)

* Translate external inputs into calls into the service layer.

| Web | Receives web requests and translates them into Commands, passing them to the Internal Message Bus.
| Event Consumer | Reads Events from the External Message Bus and translates them into Commands, passing them to the Internal Message Bus.

| n/a | External Message Bus (Message Broker) | A piece of infrastructure that different services use to intercommunicate, via Events.
