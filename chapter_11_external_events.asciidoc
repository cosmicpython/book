== Event-Driven Architecture: Using Events to Integrate Microservices

In the last chapter we never actually spoke about _how_ we would receive
the "batch quantity changed" events, or indeed, how we might notify the
outside world about reallocations.

We've got a microservice with a web API, but what about other ways of talking
to other systems?  How will we know if, say, a shipment is delayed or the
quantity is amended? How will we tell the warehouse system that an order has
been allocated and needs to be sent to a customer?

In this chapter we'd like to show how the events metaphor can be extended
to encompass the way that we handle incoming and outgoing messages from the
system. Internally, the core of our application is now a message processor.
Let's follow through on that so it becomes a message processor _externally_ as
well. As shown in <<message_processor_diagram>>, our application will receive
events from external sources via an external message bus (we'll use Redis pubsub
queues as an example), and publish its outputs, in the form of events, back
there as well.

=== Distributed Ball of Mud, and Thinking in Nouns

Before we get into that, let's talk about the alternatives. We regularly talk to
engineers who are trying to build out a Microservices architecture. Often they
are migrating from an existing application, and their first instinct is to
split their system up into _nouns_.

What nouns have we introduced so far in our system? Well, we have batches of
stock, we have orders, products, and customers. So a naive attempt at breaking
up the system might have looked like <<batches_context_diagram>> (notice that
we've named our system after a noun, _batches_, instead of _allocation_).

[[batches_context_diagram]]

System(batches, "Batches", "Knows about available stock")
Person(customer, "Customer", "Wants to buy furniture")
System(orders, "Orders", "Knows about customer orders")
System(warehouse, "Warehouse", "Knows about shipping instructions")

Rel_R(customer, orders, "Places order with")
Rel_D(orders, batches, "Reserves stock with")
Rel_D(batches, warehouse, "Sends instructions to")

@enduml
----

Each "thing" in our system has an associated service, which exposes an HTTP API.

Let's work through an example happy-path flow in <<command_flow_diagram_1>>:
our users visit a website and can choose from products that are in stock. When
they add an item to their basket, we will reserve some stock for them. When an
order is complete, we confirm the reservation, which causes us to send dispatch
instructions to the warehouse. Let's also say, if this is the customer's third
order, we want to update the customer record to flag them as a VIP.

TODO (EJ1)

I'm having a little bit of trouble understanding the sequence diagrams in this section
because I'm unsure what the arrow semantics are. The couple things I've noticed are:

* PlantUML renders synchronous messages with a non-standard arrowhead that
  looks like a cross between the synch/async messages in standard UML. Other
  users have had this complaint and there is a fix that just involves adding
  the directive skinparam style strictuml.

* The use of different line-types and arrowheads is in-consistent between
  diagrams, which makes things harder to understand. (Or I am mis-understanding
  the examples.)

A legend that explicitly defines the arrow meanings would be helpful. And maybe
developing examples over the preceding chapters would build familiarity with
the different symbols.
////


We can think of each of these steps as a Command in our system: `ReserveStock`,
`ConfirmReservation`, `DispatchGoods`, `MakeCustomerVIP`...

This style of architecture, where we create a microservice per database table,
and treat our HTTP APIs as CRUD interfaces to anemic models is the most common
initial way for people to approach service-oriented design.

This works _fine_ for systems that are very simple, but quickly degrades into
a Distributed Ball of Mud.

To see why, let's consider another case. Sometimes, when stock arrives at the
warehouse, we discover that items have been water damaged during transit. We
can't sell water damaged sofas, so we have to throw them away, and request more
stock from our partners. We also need to update our stock model, and that
might mean we need to re-allocate a customer's order.

Where does this logic go?

Well, the warehouse system knows that the stock has been damaged, so maybe it
should own this process, as shown in <<command_flow_diagram_2>>?

[[command_flow_diagram_2]]
.Command Flow 2

[plantuml, command_flow_diagram_2, config=plantuml.cfg]
@startuml

actor w as "Warehouse worker"
entity Warehouse
entity Batches
entity Orders

  w -> Warehouse: Report stock damage
  activate Warehouse
  Warehouse -> Batches: Decrease available stock
  Batches -> Batches: Reallocate orders
  Batches -> Orders: Update order status
  Orders -> CRM: Update order history
  deactivate Warehouse

@enduml
----

This sort of works, too, but now our dependency graph is a mess. In order to
allocate stock, the orders service drives the batches system, which drives
warehouse; but in order to handle problems at the warehouse, our warehouse
system drives batches, which drives orders.

Multiply this by all the other workflows we need to provide, and you can see
how services very quickly get tangled up together.

=== Error Handling in Distributed Systems ===

"Things break" is a universal law of software engineering. What happens in our
system when one of our requests fails? Let's say that a network error happens
right after we take a user's order for 3 MISBEGOTTEN-RUG,
<<command_flow_diagram_with_error>>.

[[command_flow_diagram_with_error]]
.Command Flow with Error

@startuml

actor Customer
entity Orders
entity Batches

Customer -> Orders: Place order
Orders -[#red]x Batches: Confirm reservation
hnote right: network error
Orders --> Customer: ???

@enduml
----


We have two options here: we can place the order anyway, and leave it
unallocated, or we can refuse to take the order since the allocation can't be
guaranteed. The failure state of our batches service has bubbled up and is
affecting the reliability of our order service.

When two things have to be changed together, we say that they are _coupled_. We
can think of this failure-cascade as a kind of _temporal coupling_ - every part
of the system has to work at the same time for any part of it to work. As the
system gets bigger, there is an exponentially increasing probability that some
part is degraded.

[[connascence_sidebar]]
.Connascence
*******************************************************************************
We're using the language of "coupling" here, but there's another way to describe
the relationships between our systems. Connascence is a term used by some
authors to describe the different types of coupling.

Connascence isn't _bad_ but some types of connascence are _stronger_ than
others. We want to have strong connascence locally, like when two classes are
closely related, but weak connascence at a distance.

In our first example of a distributed ball of mud, we see Connascence of
Execution - multiple components need to know the correct order of work for an
operation to be successful.

When thinking about error conditions here, we're talking about Connascence of
Timing - multiple things have to happen one after another for the operation to
work.

When we replace our RPC style system with events, we replace both of these types
of connascence with a _weaker_ type: Connascence of Name, where multiple
components only need to agree on the name of an event, and the names of fields
it carries.

We can never completely avoid coupling, except by having our software not talk
to any other software. What we want is to avoid _inappropriate_ coupling.
Connascence provides a mental model for understanding the strength and type of
coupling inherent in different architectural styles. Read all about it at
http://www.connascence.io[connascence.io]
*******************************************************************************


=== The Alternative: Temporal Decoupling using Asynchronous Messaging

We've already seen part of the answer, which is that we should think in
terms of verbs, not nouns.  Our domain model is about modelling a business
process; it's not a static data model about a thing, it's a model of a verb.

So instead of thinking about a system for orders and a system for batches,
we think about a system for _ordering_ and a system for _allocating_, and
so on.

When we separate things this way, it's a little easier to see which system
should be responsible for what.  When thinking about _ordering_, really we want
to make sure that when we place an order, the order is placed. Everything else
can happen _later_ so long as it happens.

NOTE: If this sounds familiar, it should!  Segregating responsibilities is
    the same process we went through when designing our aggregates and commands.

Like aggregates, microservices should be _consistency boundaries_. Between two
services, we can accept eventual consistency, and that means we don't need to
rely on synchronous calls. Each service accepts commands from the outside world
and raises events to record the result. Other services can listen to those
events to trigger the next steps in the workflow.

To avoid the "Distributed BOM" antipattern, instead of temporally coupled HTTP
API calls, we want to use asynchronous messaging to integrate our systems. We
want our "batch quantity changed" messages to come in as external messages from
upstream systems, and we want our system to publish "allocated" events for
downstream systems to listen to.

Why is this better? Firstly, because things can fail independently, it's easier
to handle degraded behavior: we can still take orders if the allocations system
is having a bad day.

Secondly, we're reducing the strength of coupling between our systems. If we
need to change the order of operations, or to introduce new steps in the process
we can do that locally.

// TODO: need to add an example of a process change.  And/or explain "locally"
// (EJ3) I think this is clear enough.  Not sure about for a junior dev.


=== Using a Redis Pubsub Channel for Integration

Let's see how it will all work concretely. We'll need some way of getting
events out of one system and into another, like our message bus, but for
services. This piece of infrastructure is often called a Message Broker. The
role of a message broker is to take messages from publishers and deliver them
to subscribers.

At MADE.com we use https://eventstore.org/[Event Store]; Kafka or RabbitMQ
are valid alternatives. A lightweight solution based on Redis
https://redis.io/topics/pubsub[pubsub channels] can also work just fine, and since
Redis is much more generally familiar to people, we thought we'd use it for this
book.

NOTE: We're glossing over the complexity involved in choosing the right messaging
    platform.  Concerns like message ordering, failure handling and idempotency
    all need to be thought through.  For a few pointers, see the
    <<footguns,Footguns>> section in <<epilogue_1_how_to_get_there_from_here>>.


Our new flow will look like this:

    Domain_Model -> MessageBus : emit Allocated event(s)

=== Test-Driving It All Using an End-To-End Test

Here's how we might start with an end-to-end test.  We can use our existing
API to create batches, and then we'll test both inbound and outbound messages:


[[redis_e2e_test]]
.An end-to-end test for our pubsub model (tests/e2e/test_external_events.py)
====
[source,python]
----
def test_change_batch_quantity_leading_to_reallocation():
    # start with two batches and an order allocated to one of them  #<1>
    orderid, sku = random_orderid(), random_sku()
    earlier_batch, later_batch = random_batchref('old'), random_batchref('newer')
    api_client.post_to_add_batch(earlier_batch, sku, qty=10, eta='2011-01-02')  #<2>
    api_client.post_to_add_batch(later_batch, sku, qty=10, eta='2011-01-02')  #<2>
    response = api_client.post_to_allocate(orderid, sku, 10)  #<2>
    assert response.json()['batchref'] == earlier_batch

    subscription = redis_client.subscribe_to('line_allocated')  #<3>

    # change quantity on allocated batch so it's less than our order  #<1>
    redis_client.publish_message('change_batch_quantity', {  #<3>
        'batchref': earlier_batch, 'qty': 5
    })

    # wait until we see a message saying the order has been reallocated  #<1>
    messages = []
    for attempt in Retrying(stop=stop_after_delay(3), reraise=True):  #<4>
        with attempt:
            message = subscription.get_message(timeout=1)
            if message:
                messages.append(message)
                print(messages)
            data = json.loads(messages[-1]['data'])
            assert data['orderid'] == orderid
            assert data['batchref'] == later_batch
----
====

<1> You can read the story of what's going on in this test from the comments:
    we want to send an event into the system that causes an order line to be
    reallocated, and we see that reallocation come out as an event in redis too.

<2> `api_client` is a little helper that we refactored out to share between
    our two test types, it wraps our calls to `requests.post`

<3> `redis_client` is another test little test helper, the details of which
    don't really matter; its job is to be able to send and receive messages
    from various Redis channels. We'll use a channel called
    `change_batch_quantity` to send in our request to change the quantity for a
    batch, and we'll listen to another channel called `line_allocated` to
    look out for the expected reallocation.

<4> Because of the asynchronous nature of the system under test, we need to use
    the `tenacity` library again to add a retry loop.  Firstly because it may
    take some time for our new `line_allocated` message to arrive, but also
    because it won't be the only message on that channel.

////
TODO (EJ3) Minor comment: This e2e test might not be safe or repeatable as part of a
     larger test suite, since test run data is being persisted in redis.
     Purging the queue as part of setup will help, but it would still have problems
     with running tests in parallel. Not sure if it's worth bringing up as it might
     be too much of a digression.

==== Redis Is Another Thin Adapter Around Our Message Bus

Our Redis pubsub listener (we call it an _eventconsumer_) is very much like
Flask:  it translates from the outside world to our events:


[[redis_eventconsumer_first_cut]]
.Simple Redis message listener (src/allocation/entrypoints/redis_eventconsumer.py)
====
[source,python]
----
r = redis.Redis(**config.get_redis_host_and_port())


def main():
    orm.start_mappers()
    pubsub = r.pubsub(ignore_subscribe_messages=True)
    pubsub.subscribe('change_batch_quantity')  #<1>

    for m in pubsub.listen():
        handle_change_batch_quantity(m)


def handle_change_batch_quantity(m):
    logging.debug('handling %s', m)
    data = json.loads(m['data'])  #<2>
    cmd = commands.ChangeBatchQuantity(ref=data['batchref'], qty=data['qty'])  #<2>
    messagebus.handle(cmd, uow=unit_of_work.SqlAlchemyUnitOfWork())
----
====

<1> `main()` subscribes us to the `change_batch_quantity` channel on load

<2> And our main job as an entrypoint to the system is to deserialize JSON,
    convert it to a `Command`, and pass it to the service layer--much like the
    Flask adapter does.

We also build a new downstream adapter to do the opposit job: it converts
domain events to public events:

[[redis_eventpubisher_first_cut]]
.Simple Redis message publisher (src/allocation/adapters/redis_eventpublisher.py)
====
[source,python]
----
r = redis.Redis(**config.get_redis_host_and_port())


def publish(channel, event: events.Event):  #<1>
    logging.debug('publishing: channel=%s, event=%s', channel, event)
    r.publish(channel, json.dumps(asdict(event)))
----
====

<1> We take a hard-coded channel here, but you could also store
    a mapping between event classes/names and the appropriate channel,
    allowing one or more message types to go to different channels...


==== Our New Outgoing Event

Here's what the `Allocated` event will look like:

[[allocated_event]]
.New event (src/allocation/domain/events.py)
====
[source,python]
----
@dataclass
class Allocated(Event):
    orderid: str
    sku: str
    qty: int
    batchref: str
----
====

It captures everything we need to know about an allocation: the details of the
order line, and which batch it was allocated to.

We add it into our model's `allocate()` method (having added a test
first, naturally)

[[model_emits_allocated_event]]
.Product.allocate() emits new event to record what happened (src/allocation/domain/model.py)
====
[source,python]
----
class Product:
    ...
    def allocate(self, line: OrderLine) -> str:
        ...

            batch.allocate(line)
            self.version_number += 1
            self.events.append(events.Allocated(
                orderid=line.orderid, sku=line.sku, qty=line.qty,
                batchref=batch.reference,
            ))
            return batch.reference
----
====


The handler for `ChangeBatchQuantity` already exists, so all we need to add
is a handler that publishes the outgoing event:


[[another_handler]]
.The messagebus grows (src/allocation/service_layer/messagebus.py)
====
[source,python,highlight=2]
----
HANDLERS = {
    events.Allocated: [handlers.publish_allocated_event],
    events.OutOfStock: [handlers.send_out_of_stock_notification],
}  # type: Dict[Type[events.Event], List[Callable]]
----
====

Publishing the event uses our helper function from the Redis wrapper:

[[publish_event_handler]]
.Publish to redis (src/allocation/service_layer/handlers.py)
====
[source,python]
----
def publish_allocated_event(
        event: events.Allocated, uow: unit_of_work.AbstractUnitOfWork,
):
    redis_eventpublisher.publish('line_allocated', event)
----
====


TIP: Outbound events are one of the places it's important to apply some validation.
    See <<appendix_validation>> for some validation philosophy and examples.



.Internal vs External events
*******************************************************************************
It's a good idea to keep the distinction between internal and external events
clear.  Some events may come from the outside, and some events may get upgraded
and published externally, but not all of them.  This is particularly important
if you get into
https://io.made.com/blog/2018-04-28-eventsourcing-101.html[event sourcing]
(very much a topic for another book though).

*******************************************************************************

=== Wrap-Up

Events can come _from_ the outside, but they can also be published
externally--our `publish` handler converts an event to a message on a Redis
channel. We use events to talk to the outside world.  This kind of temporal
decoupling buys us a lot of flexibility in our application integrations, but,
as always, it comes at a cost.

[quote, Martin Fowler, What do you mean by “Event-Driven”? (martinfowler.com)]
____
Event notification is nice because it implies a low level of coupling, and is
pretty simple to set up. It can become problematic, however, if there is
a logical flow that runs over various event notifications. [...] It can be hard to
see as it's not explicit in any program text; this can make it hard to debug
and modify.
____

If you're moving from a model of synchronous messaging to an async one, you
also open up a whole host of problems to do with message reliability and eventual
consistency.   Read on to the <<footguns>> section in the epilogue.
