== Unit of Work Pattern

In this chapter we'll introduce the final piece of the puzzle that ties
together ((("Unit of Work pattern", id="ix_UoW")))the Repository and Service Layer patterns: the _Unit of Work_ pattern.

If the Repository pattern is our abstraction over the idea of persistent storage,
the Unit of Work (UoW) pattern is our abstraction over the idea of _atomic operations_.((("atomic operations"))) It
will allow us to finally and fully decouple our service layer from the data layer.((("UoW", see="Unit of Work pattern")))

<<before_uow_diagram>> shows that, currently, a lot of communication occurs
across the layers of our infrastructure: the API talks directly to the database
layer to start a session, it talks to the repository layer to initialize
`SQLAlchemyRepository`, and it talks to the service layer to ask it to allocate.((("APIs", "without Unit of Work pattern, talking directly to three layers")))((("Unit of Work pattern", "without, API talking directly to three layers")))

.Without UoW: API talks directly to three layers

<<after_uow_diagram>> shows our target state. The Flask API now does only two
things: it initializes a unit of work, and it invokes a service. The service
collaborates with the UoW (we like to think of the UoW as being part of the
service layer), but neither the service function itself nor Flask now needs
to talk directly to the database.((("Unit of Work pattern", "managing database state")))((("databases", "Unit of Work pattern managing state for")))

And we'll do it all using a lovely piece((("context manager"))) of Python syntax, a context manager.

=== The Unit of Work Collaborates with the Repository

//TODO (DS) do you talk anywhere about multiple repositories?

Let's see the unit of work (or UoW, which we pronounce "you-wow") in action. Here's how the service((("Unit of Work pattern", "collaboration with repository")))((("repositories", "Unit of Work collaborating with"))) layer will look when we're finished:

[[uow_preview]]
.Preview of unit of work in action (src/allocation/service_layer/services.py)
====
[source,python]
----
def allocate(
        orderid: str, sku: str, qty: int,
        uow: unit_of_work.AbstractUnitOfWork
) -> str:
    line = OrderLine(orderid, sku, qty)
    with uow:  #<1>
        batches = uow.batches.list()  #<2>
        ...
        batchref = model.allocate(line, batches)
        uow.commit()  #<3>
----
====

<1> We'll start a UoW as a context manager.((("context manager", "starting Unit of Work as")))
<2> `uow.batches` is the batches repo, so the UoW provides us
    access to our permanent storage.((("storage", "permanent, UoW providing entrypoint to")))
<3> When we're done, we commit or roll back our work, using the UoW.

The UoW acts as a single entrypoint to our persistent storage, and it
 keeps track of what objects were loaded and of the latest state.footnote:[
You may have come across the use of the word _collaborators_ to describe objects that work
together to achieve a goal.((("collaborators"))) The unit of work and the repository are a great
example of collaborators in the object-modeling sense.
In responsibility-driven design, clusters of objects((("object neighborhoods"))) that collaborate in their
roles are called _object neighborhoods_, which is, in our professional opinion,
totally adorable.]

This gives us three useful things:

* A stable snapshot of the database to work with, so the
   objects we use aren't changing halfway through an operation

* A way to persist all of our changes at once, so if something
   goes wrong, we don't end up in an inconsistent state

* A simple API to our persistence concerns and a handy place
   to get a repository



=== Test-Driving a UoW with Integration Tests

Here are our ((("integration tests", "test-driving Unit of Work with")))((("testing", "Unit of Work with integration tests")))((("Unit of Work pattern", "test driving with integration tests")))integration tests for the UOW:


[[test_unit_of_work]]
.A basic "round-trip" test for a UoW (tests/integration/test_uow.py)
====
[source,python]
----
def test_uow_can_retrieve_a_batch_and_allocate_to_it(session_factory):
    session = session_factory()
    insert_batch(session, 'batch1', 'HIPSTER-WORKBENCH', 100, None)
    session.commit()

    uow = unit_of_work.SqlAlchemyUnitOfWork(session_factory)  #<1>
    with uow:
        batch = uow.batches.get(reference='batch1')  #<2>
        line = model.OrderLine('o1', 'HIPSTER-WORKBENCH', 10)
        batch.allocate(line)
        uow.commit()  #<3>

    batchref = get_allocated_batch_ref(session, 'o1', 'HIPSTER-WORKBENCH')
    assert batchref == 'batch1'
----
====

<1> We initialize the UoW by using our custom session factory
    and get back a `uow` object to use in our `with` block.

<2> The UoW gives us access to the batches repository via
    `uow.batches`.

<3> We call `commit()` on it when we're done.

For the curious, the `insert_batch` and `get_allocated_batch_ref` helpers
look like((("SQL", "helpers for Unit of Work"))) this:

[[sql_helpers]]
.Helpers for doing SQL stuff (tests/integration/test_uow.py)
====
[source,python]
----
def insert_batch(session, ref, sku, qty, eta):
    session.execute(
        'INSERT INTO batches (reference, sku, _purchased_quantity, eta)'
        ' VALUES (:ref, :sku, :qty, :eta)',
        dict(ref=ref, sku=sku, qty=qty, eta=eta)
    )


def get_allocated_batch_ref(session, orderid, sku):
    [[orderlineid]] = session.execute(
        'SELECT id FROM order_lines WHERE orderid=:orderid AND sku=:sku',
        dict(orderid=orderid, sku=sku)
    )
    [[batchref]] = session.execute(
        'SELECT b.reference FROM allocations JOIN batches AS b ON batch_id = b.id'
        ' WHERE orderline_id=:orderlineid',
        dict(orderlineid=orderlineid)
    )
    return batchref
----
====


=== Unit of Work and Its Context Manager

In our tests we've implicitly defined an interface for what a UoW needs to do. Let's make that explicit by using an ((("abstractions", "AbstractUnitOfWork")))((("Unit of Work pattern", "and its context manager")))((("context manager", "Unit of Work and", id="ix_ctxtmgr")))abstract
base class:


[[abstract_unit_of_work]]
.Abstract UoW context manager (src/allocation/service_layer/unit_of_work.py)
====
[source,python]
[role="skip"]
----
class AbstractUnitOfWork(abc.ABC):
    batches: repository.AbstractRepository  #<1>

    def __exit__(self, *args):  #<2>
        self.rollback()  #<4>

    @abc.abstractmethod
    def commit(self):  #<3>
        raise NotImplementedError

    @abc.abstractmethod
    def rollback(self):  #<4>
        raise NotImplementedError
----
====

<1> The UoW provides an attribute called `.batches`, which will give us access
    to the batches repository.

<2> If you've never seen a context manager, +++<code>__enter__</code>+++ and +++<code>__exit__</code>+++ are
    the two magic methods that execute when we enter the `with` block and
    when we exit it, respectively.((("&#x5f;&#x5f;enter&#x5f;&#x5f; and &#x5f;&#x5f;exit&#x5f;&#x5f; magic methods", primary-sortas="enter and exit"))) They're our setup and teardown phases.((("magic methods", "&#x5f;&#x5f;enter&#x5f;&#x5f; and &#x5f;&#x5f;exit&#x5f;&#x5f;", secondary-sortas="enter")))

<3> We'll call this method to explicitly commit our work when we're ready.

<4> If we don't((("rollbacks"))) commit, or if we exit the context manager by raising an error,
    we do a `rollback`. (The rollback has no effect if `commit()` has been
    called. Read on for more discussion of this.)

// TODO: bring this code listing back under test, remove `return self` from all the uows.


==== The Real Unit of Work Uses SQLAlchemy Sessions

The main thing that our concrete implementation adds is the
database ((("Unit of Work pattern", "and its context manager", "real UoW using SQLAlchemy session")))((("SQLAlchemy", "database session for Unit of Work")))((("databases", "SQLAlchemy adding session for Unit of Work")))session:

[[unit_of_work]]
.The real SQLAlchemy UoW (src/allocation/service_layer/unit_of_work.py)
====
[source,python]
----
DEFAULT_SESSION_FACTORY = sessionmaker(bind=create_engine(  #<1>
    config.get_postgres_uri(),
))

class SqlAlchemyUnitOfWork(AbstractUnitOfWork):

    def __init__(self, session_factory=DEFAULT_SESSION_FACTORY):
        self.session_factory = session_factory  #<1>

    def __enter__(self):
        self.session = self.session_factory()  # type: Session  #<2>
        self.batches = repository.SqlAlchemyRepository(self.session)  #<2>
        return super().__enter__()

    def __exit__(self, *args):
        super().__exit__(*args)
        self.session.close()  #<3>

    def commit(self):  #<4>
        self.session.commit()

    def rollback(self):  #<4>
        self.session.rollback()

----
====

<1> The module defines a default session factory that will connect to Postgres,
    but we allow that to be overridden in our integration tests so that we
    can use SQLite instead.

<2> The +++<code>__enter__</code>+++ method is responsible for starting a database session and instantiating
    a real repository that can use that session.((("&#x5f;&#x5f;enter&#x5f;&#x5f; and &#x5f;&#x5f;exit&#x5f;&#x5f; magic methods", primary-sortas="enter and exit")))

<3> We close the session on exit.

<4> Finally, we provide concrete `commit()` and `rollback()` methods that
    use our database session.((("rollbacks", "rollback method")))((("commits", "commit method")))

//IDEA: why not swap out db using os.environ?
// (EJ2) Could be a good idea to point out that this couples the unit of work to postgres.
//         This does get dealt with in in bootstrap, so you could make a forward-reference.
// (EJ3) IIRC using a factory like this is considered an antipattern ("Control-Freak" from M.Seeman's book)
//         Is there a reason to inject a factory instead of a session?
// (HP) yes because each unit of work needs to start a new session every time
// we call __enter__ and close it on __exit__



==== Fake Unit of Work for Testing

Here's how we use a fake UoW in((("Unit of Work pattern", "and its context manager", "fake UoW for testing")))((("faking", "FakeUnitOfWork for service layer testing")))((("testing", "fake UoW for service layer testing"))) our service-layer tests:

[[fake_unit_of_work]]
.Fake UoW (tests/unit/test_services.py)
====
[source,python]
----
class FakeUnitOfWork(unit_of_work.AbstractUnitOfWork):

    def __init__(self):
        self.batches = FakeRepository([])  #<1>
        self.committed = False  #<2>

    def commit(self):
        self.committed = True  #<2>

    def rollback(self):
        pass



def test_add_batch():
    uow = FakeUnitOfWork()  #<3>
    services.add_batch("b1", "CRUNCHY-ARMCHAIR", 100, None, uow)  #<3>
    assert uow.batches.get("b1") is not None
    assert uow.committed


def test_allocate_returns_allocation():
    uow = FakeUnitOfWork()  #<3>
    services.add_batch("batch1", "COMPLICATED-LAMP", 100, None, uow)  #<3>
    result = services.allocate("o1", "COMPLICATED-LAMP", 10, uow)  #<3>
    assert result == "batch1"
...
----
====

<1> `FakeUnitOfWork` and `FakeRepository` are tightly coupled,
    just like the real `UnitofWork` and `Repository` classes.
    That's fine because we recognize that the objects are collaborators.

<2> Notice the similarity with the fake `commit()` function
    from `FakeSession` (which we can now get rid of). But it's
    a substantial improvement because we're now [.keep-together]#faking# out
    code that we wrote rather than third-party code. Some
    people say, https://oreil.ly/0LVj3["Don't mock what you don't own"].

<3> In our tests, we can instantiate a UoW and pass it to
    our service layer, rather than passing a repository and a session.
    This is considerably less cumbersome.

[role="nobreakinside less_space"]
.Don't Mock What You Don't Own
********************************************************************************
Why do we feel more comfortable mocking the UoW than the session?((("mocking", "don&#x27;t mock what you don&#x27;t own")))((("SQLAlchemy", "database session for Unit of Work", "not mocking")))
Both of our fakes achieve the same thing: they give us a way to swap out our
persistence layer so we can run tests in memory instead of needing to
talk to a real database. The difference is in the resulting design.

If we cared only about writing tests that run quickly, we could create mocks
that replace SQLAlchemy and use those throughout our codebase. The problem is
that `Session` is a complex object that exposes lots of persistence-related
functionality. It's easy to use `Session` to make arbitrary queries against
the database, but that quickly leads to data access code being sprinkled all
over the codebase. To avoid that, we want to limit access to our persistence
layer so each component has exactly what it needs and nothing more.

By coupling to the `Session` interface, you're choosing to couple to all the
complexity of SQLAlchemy. Instead, we want to choose a simpler abstraction and
use that to clearly separate responsibilities. Our UoW is much simpler
than a session, and we feel comfortable with the service layer being able to
start and stop units of work.

"Don't mock what you don't own" is a rule of thumb that forces us to build
these simple abstractions over messy subsystems. This has the same performance
benefit as mocking the SQLAlchemy session but encourages us to think carefully
about our designs.((("context manager", "Unit of Work and", startref="ix_ctxtmgr")))
********************************************************************************

=== Using the UoW in the Service Layer

Here's what our new service ((("service layer", "using Unit of Work in")))((("Unit of Work pattern", "using UoW in service layer")))layer looks like:


[[service_layer_with_uow]]
.Service layer using UoW (src/allocation/service_layer/services.py)
====
[source,python]
----
def add_batch(
        ref: str, sku: str, qty: int, eta: Optional[date],
        uow: unit_of_work.AbstractUnitOfWork  #<1>
):
    with uow:
        uow.batches.add(model.Batch(ref, sku, qty, eta))
        uow.commit()


def allocate(
        orderid: str, sku: str, qty: int,
        uow: unit_of_work.AbstractUnitOfWork  #<1>
) -> str:
    line = OrderLine(orderid, sku, qty)
    with uow:
        batches = uow.batches.list()
        if not is_valid_sku(line.sku, batches):
            raise InvalidSku(f'Invalid sku {line.sku}')
        batchref = model.allocate(line, batches)
        uow.commit()
    return batchref
----
====

<1> Our service layer now has only the one dependency, once again
    on an _abstract_ UoW.((("dependencies", "service layer dependency on abstract UoW")))


=== Explicit Tests for Commit/Rollback Behavior

To convince ourselves that the commit/rollback behavior works, we wrote
a couple ((("commits", "explicit tests for")))((("rollbacks", "explicit tests for")))((("Unit of Work pattern", "explicit tests for commit/rollback behavior")))((("testing", "integration tests for rollback behavior")))of tests:

[[testing_rollback]]
.Integration tests for rollback behavior (tests/integration/test_uow.py)
====
[source,python]
----
def test_rolls_back_uncommitted_work_by_default(session_factory):
    uow = unit_of_work.SqlAlchemyUnitOfWork(session_factory)
    with uow:
        insert_batch(uow.session, 'batch1', 'MEDIUM-PLINTH', 100, None)

    new_session = session_factory()
    rows = list(new_session.execute('SELECT * FROM "batches"'))
    assert rows == []


def test_rolls_back_on_error(session_factory):
    class MyException(Exception):
        pass

    uow = unit_of_work.SqlAlchemyUnitOfWork(session_factory)
    with pytest.raises(MyException):
        with uow:
            insert_batch(uow.session, 'batch1', 'LARGE-FORK', 100, None)
            raise MyException()

    new_session = session_factory()
    rows = list(new_session.execute('SELECT * FROM "batches"'))
    assert rows == []
----
====

TIP: We haven't shown it here, but it can be worth testing some of the more
    "obscure" database behavior, like transactions, against the "real"
    database—that is, the same engine.((("databases", "testing transactions against real database"))) For now, we're getting away with using
    SQLite instead of Postgres, but in <<chapter_07_aggregate>>, we'll switch
    some of the tests to using the real database. It's convenient that our UoW
    class makes that easy!


=== Explicit Versus Implicit Commits

Now we briefly digress on different ways of implementing the UoW pattern.((("Unit of Work pattern", "explicit versus implicit commits")))((("commits", "explicit versus implicit")))((("implicit versus explicit commits")))

We could imagine a slightly different version of the UoW that commits by default
and rolls back only if it spots an exception:

[[uow_implicit_commit]]
.A UoW with implicit commit... (src/allocation/unit_of_work.py)
====
[source,python]
[role="skip"]
----

class AbstractUnitOfWork(abc.ABC):

    def __enter__(self):
        return self

    def __exit__(self, exn_type, exn_value, traceback):
        if exn_type is None:
            self.commit()  #<1>
        else:
            self.rollback()  #<2>
----
====

<1> Should we have an implicit commit in the happy path?
<2> And roll back only on exception?

It would allow us to save a line of code and to remove the explicit commit from our
client code:

[[add_batch_nocommit]]
.\...would save us a line of code (src/allocation/service_layer/services.py)
====
[source,python]
[role="skip"]
----
def add_batch(ref: str, sku: str, qty: int, eta: Optional[date], uow):
    with uow:
        uow.batches.add(model.Batch(ref, sku, qty, eta))
        # uow.commit()
----
====

This is a judgment call, but we tend to prefer requiring the explicit commit
so that we have to choose when to flush state.

Although we use an extra line of code, this makes the software safe by default.
The default behavior is to _not change anything_. In turn, that makes our code
easier to reason about because there's only one code path that leads to changes
in the system: total success and an explicit commit. Any other code path, any
exception, any early exit from the UoW's scope leads to a safe state.

Similarly, we prefer to roll back by default because
it's easier to understand; this rolls back to the last commit,
so either the user did one, or we blow their changes away. Harsh but simple.

=== Examples: Using UoW to Group Multiple Operations into an Atomic Unit

Here are a few examples showing the Unit of Work pattern in use.((("Unit of Work pattern", "using UoW to group multiple operations into atomic unit", id="ix_UoWatom")))((("atomic operations", "using Unit of Work to group  operations into atomic unit", id="ix_atomops"))) You can
see how it leads to simple reasoning about what blocks of code happen
together.

==== Example 1: Reallocate

Suppose we want to be able to deallocate and ((("reallocate service function")))((("Unit of Work pattern", "using UoW to group multiple operations into atomic unit", "reallocate function example")))then reallocate orders:

[[reallocate]]
.Reallocate service function
====
[source,python]
[role="skip"]
----
def reallocate(line: OrderLine, uow: AbstractUnitOfWork) -> str:
    with uow:
        batch = uow.batches.get(sku=line.sku)
        if batch is None:
            raise InvalidSku(f'Invalid sku {line.sku}')
        batch.deallocate(line)  #<1>
        allocate(line)  #<2>
        uow.commit()
----
====

<1> If `deallocate()` fails, we don't want to call `allocate()`, obviously.
<2> If `allocate()` fails, we probably don't want to actually commit
    the `deallocate()` either.


==== Example 2: Change Batch Quantity

Our shipping company gives us a call to say that one of the container doors
opened, and half our sofas have fallen into the Indian Ocean. Oops!((("Unit of Work pattern", "using UoW to group multiple operations into atomic unit", "changing batch quantity example")))


[[change_batch_quantity]]
.Change quantity
====
[source,python]
[role="skip"]
----
def change_batch_quantity(batchref: str, new_qty: int, uow: AbstractUnitOfWork):
    with uow:
        batch = uow.batches.get(reference=batchref)
        batch.change_purchased_quantity(new_qty)
        while batch.available_quantity < 0:
            line = batch.deallocate_one()  #<1>
        uow.commit()
----
====

<1> Here we may need to deallocate any number of lines. If we get a failure
    at any stage, we probably want to commit none of the changes.((("atomic operations", "using Unit of Work to group  operations into atomic unit", startref="ix_atomops")))((("Unit of Work pattern", "using UoW to group multiple operations into atomic unit", startref="ix_UoWatom")))


=== Tidying Up the Integration Tests

We now have three sets of tests, all essentially pointing at the database:
_test_orm.py_, _test_repository.py_, and _test_uow.py_. Should((("testing", "Unit of Work with integration tests", "tidying up tests")))((("Unit of Work pattern", "tidying up integration tests"))) we throw any
away?

====

----
====

You should always feel free to throw away tests if you think they're not going to
add value longer term. We'd say that _test_orm.py_ was primarily a tool to help
us learn SQLAlchemy, so we won't need that long term, especially if the main things
it's doing are covered in _test_repository.py_. That last test, you might keep around,
but we could certainly see an argument for just keeping everything at the highest
possible level of abstraction (just as we did for the unit tests).

[role="nobreakinside less_space"]
.Exercise for the Reader
******************************************************************************
For this chapter, probably the best thing to try is to implement a
UoW from scratch. The code, as always, is https://github.com/cosmicpython/code/tree/chapter_06_uow_exercise[on GitHub]. You could either follow the model we have quite closely,
or perhaps experiment with separating the UoW (whose responsibilities are
`commit()`, `rollback()`, and providing the `.batches` repository) from the
context manager, whose job is to initialize things, and then do the commit
or rollback on exit. If you feel like going all-functional rather than
messing about with all these classes, you could use `@contextmanager` from
`contextlib`.

We've stripped out both the actual UoW and the fakes, as well as paring back
the abstract UoW. Why not send us a link to your repo if you come up with
something you're particularly proud of?
******************************************************************************

TIP: This is another example of the lesson from <<chapter_05_high_gear_low_gear>>:
    as we build better abstractions, we can move our tests to run against them,
    which leaves us free to change the underlying details.


=== Wrap-Up

Hopefully we've convinced you that the Unit of Work pattern is useful, and
that the context manager is a really nice Pythonic way
of visually grouping code into blocks that we want to happen atomically.((("Unit of Work pattern", "benefits of using")))

This pattern is so useful, in fact, that SQLAlchemy already uses a UoW
in the shape of the `Session` object.((("SQLAlchemy", "Session object")))((("Session object"))) The `Session` object in SQLAlchemy is the way
that your application loads data from the database.

Every time you load a new entity from the database, the session begins to _track_
changes to the entity, and when the session is _flushed_, all your changes are
persisted together. Why do we go to the effort of abstracting away the SQLAlchemy session if it already implements the pattern we want?

<<chapter_06_uow_tradeoffs>> discusses ((("Unit of Work pattern", "pros and cons or trade-offs")))some of the trade-offs.

[[chapter_06_uow_tradeoffs]]
[options="header"]
.Unit of Work pattern: the trade-offs
|===
|Pros|Cons
a|
* We have a nice abstraction over the concept of atomic operations, and the
  context manager makes it easy to see, visually, what blocks of code are
  grouped together atomically.((("atomic operations", "Unit of Work as abstraction over")))((("transactions", "Unit of Work and")))

* We have explicit control over when a transaction starts and finishes, and our
  application fails in a way that is safe by default. We never have to worry
  that an operation is partially committed.

* It's a nice place to put all your repositories so client code can access them.

* As you'll see in later chapters, atomicity isn't only about transactions; it
  can help us work with events and the message bus.

a|
* Your ORM probably already has some perfectly good abstractions around
  atomicity. SQLAlchemy even has context managers. You can go a long way
  just passing a session around.

* We've made it look easy, but you have to think quite carefully about
  things like rollbacks, multithreading, and nested transactions. Perhaps just
  sticking to what Django or Flask-SQLAlchemy gives you will keep your life
  simpler.((("Unit of Work pattern", startref="ix_UoW")))
|===

For one thing, the Session API is rich and supports operations that we don't
want or need in our domain. Our `UnitOfWork` simplifies the session to its
essential core: it can be started, committed, or thrown away.

For another, we're using the `UnitOfWork` to access our `Repository` objects.
This is a neat bit of developer usability that we couldn't do with a plain
SQLAlchemy `Session`.

.Unit of Work Pattern Recap
*****************************************************************
The Unit of Work pattern is an abstraction around data integrity::
    It helps to enforce ((("Unit of Work pattern", "recap of important points")))the consistency of our domain model, and improves
    performance, by letting us perform a single _flush_ operation at the
    end of an operation.

It works closely with the Repository and Service Layer patterns::
    The Unit of Work pattern completes our abstractions over data access by
    representing atomic updates. Each of our service-layer use cases runs in a
    single unit of work that succeeds or fails as a block.

This is a lovely case for a context manager::
    Context managers are an idiomatic way of defining scope in Python. We can use a
    context manager to automatically roll back our work at the end of a request,
    which means the system is safe by default.

SQLAlchemy already implements this pattern::
    We introduce an even simpler abstraction over the SQLAlchemy `Session` object
    in order to "narrow" the interface between the ORM and our code. This helps
    to keep us loosely coupled.

*****************************************************************

Lastly, we're motivated again by the dependency inversion principle: our
service layer depends on a thin abstraction, and we attach a concrete
implementation at the outside edge of the system.((("dependency inversion principle"))) This lines up nicely with
SQLAlchemy's own

____
Keep the life cycle of the session (and usually the transaction) separate and
external. The most comprehensive approach, recommended for more substantial
applications, will try to keep the details of session, transaction, and
exception management as far as possible from the details of the program doing
its work.
