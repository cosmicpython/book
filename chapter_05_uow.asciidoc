== Unit of Work Pattern

In this chapter we'll introduce the final piece of the puzzle that ties
together the Repository and Service Layer: the _Unit of Work_ pattern.

If the Repository is our abstraction over the idea of persistent storage,
the Unit of Work is our abstraction over the idea of _atomic operations_. It
will allow us to finally, fully, decouple our Service Layer from the data layer.


<<before_uow_diagram>> shows that, currently, there is a lot of communication
across the layers of our infrastructure:  the API talks directly to the DB
layer to start a session, it talks to the repository layer to initialize a
`BatchRepository`, and it talks to the service layer to ask it to allocate.

<<after_uow_diagram>> shows our target state: the Flask API now only does two
things: it initializes a unit of work, and it invokes the service.  The service
collaborates with the UoW (we like to think of the UoW as being part of the
service layer), but neither the service function itself nor Flask longer needs
to talk directly to the DB.

TODO (EJ1) WRT BOB's comment below, I think it makes sense and the example would be a good
alternative. If I were learning about this for the first time, I might find the current
UoW sequence diagram confusing, as it seems to me that it doesn't exatly match the source
code at the detail level.

However, if you definitely want to use a sequence diagram, there are a couple things that might help:

*   Use Session instead of DB as the participant. That will make the syntax of
    the sequence diagram clearer, as well as matching the source code better.
    (The service layer creates a Session, which implicitly starts a transaction
    with the DB. Then Service sends a commit message to Session, as opposed to
    asking DB to commit a session).

*   This will also make the second diagram clearer, as the diagram conflicts
    with some details around how SqlAlchemy sessions work. (The SQL transaction
    doesn't actually start until the first request to the DB, so it's not clear
    if "Start Session" means start a transaction, or create a SqlAlchemy
    Session object.)

*   On the second diagram, if you include the repo as a a participant, it may
    help. Otherwise it looks like it has just disappeared and has no role in
    the interaction.

*   Some small tweaks to the implementation may help with the diagrams. If
    instead of injecting a uow instance, you inject a factory, like this:

def foo(stuff, uow_klass):
    with uow_klass() as uow:
        # do something

Then the lifecycle of the UoW instance will be the same as the context manager.
That may have a clearer diagram, because it will let you use the "Create and
Destroy" symbols on a diagram. See the "Bob" and "George" examples Shortcut
syntax for activation, deactivation, creation


(BOB)

I'm not convinced that a sequence diagram is the right way to show the
interaction here because we're not really interested in a flow of events. The
change we've made is about the structure of things and relationships, rather
than the process or order of things.

Maybe something like https://vivekcek.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/2.png would
be better? How would you sketch this change if you were explaining it to a
junior developer?
////

And we'll do it all using a lovely piece of Python syntax, a context manager.

// could talk about guidelines for what to mock?

=== The Unit of Work Collaborates with Repository(-Ies)

//TODO (DS) do you talk anywhere about multiple repositories?

Here's how it'll look in use, when it's finished:

[[uow_preview]]
.Preview of unit of work in action (src/allocation/service_layer/services.py)
====
[source,python]
----
def allocate(
        orderid: str, sku: str, qty: int,
        uow: unit_of_work.AbstractUnitOfWork
) -> str:
    line = OrderLine(orderid, sku, qty)
    with uow:  #<1>
        batches = uow.batches.list()  #<2>
        ...
        batchref = model.allocate(line, batches)
        uow.commit()  #<3>
----
====

<1> We'll start a unit of work as a context manager
<2> `uow.batches` is the batches repo, so the unit of work provides us
    access to our permanent storage.
<3> When we're done, we commit or roll back our work, using the UOW

The unit of work acts as a single entry point to our persistent storage, and
keeps track of what objects were loaded and what the latest state is.footnote:[
You may have come across the word _collaborators_, to describe objects that work
together to achieve a goal. The unit of work and the repository are a great
example of collaborators in the object modeling sense.
In responsibility-driven design, clusters of objects that collaborate in their
roles are called _object neighborhoods_ which is, in our professional opinion,
totally adorable.]
This gives us three useful things:

1. It gives us a stable snapshot of the database to work with, so that the
   objects we use aren't changing halfway through an operation.

2. It gives us a way to persist all of our changes at once so that if something
   goes wrong, we don't end up in an inconsistent state.

3. It offers a simple API to our persistence concerns and gives us a handy place
   to get a repository.


//TODO (DS): Could be a good moment to revisit the diagram at the beginning of the book.


=== Test-Driving a UoW with Integration Tests

Here's a test for a new `UnitofWork` (or UoW, which we pronounce "you-wow").
It's a context manager that allows us to start a transaction, retrieve and get
things from repos, and commit:


[[test_unit_of_work]]
.A basic "roundtrip" test for a Unit of Work (tests/integration/test_uow.py)
====
[source,python]
----
def test_uow_can_retrieve_a_batch_and_allocate_to_it(session_factory):
    session = session_factory()
    insert_batch(session, 'batch1', 'HIPSTER-WORKBENCH', 100, None)
    session.commit()

    uow = unit_of_work.SqlAlchemyUnitOfWork(session_factory)  #<1>
    with uow:
        batch = uow.batches.get(reference='batch1')  #<2>
        line = model.OrderLine('o1', 'HIPSTER-WORKBENCH', 10)
        batch.allocate(line)
        uow.commit()  #<3>

    batchref = get_allocated_batch_ref(session, 'o1', 'HIPSTER-WORKBENCH')
    assert batchref == 'batch1'
----
====

<1> We initialize the Unit of Work using our custom session factory,
    and get back a `uow` object to use in our `with` block.

<2> The UoW gives us access to the batches repository via
    `uow.batches`

<3> And we call `commit()` on it when we're done.



For the curious, the `insert_batch` and `get_allocated_batch_ref` helpers
look like this:

[[sql_helpers]]
.Helpers for doing SQL stuff (tests/integration/test_uow.py)
====
[source,python]
----
def insert_batch(session, ref, sku, qty, eta):
    session.execute(
        'INSERT INTO batches (reference, sku, _purchased_quantity, eta)'
        ' VALUES (:ref, :sku, :qty, :eta)',
        dict(ref=ref, sku=sku, qty=qty, eta=eta)
    )


def get_allocated_batch_ref(session, orderid, sku):
    [[orderlineid]] = session.execute(
        'SELECT id FROM order_lines WHERE orderid=:orderid AND sku=:sku',
        dict(orderid=orderid, sku=sku)
    )
    [[batchref]] = session.execute(
        'SELECT b.reference FROM allocations JOIN batches AS b ON batch_id = b.id'
        ' WHERE orderline_id=:orderlineid',
        dict(orderlineid=orderlineid)
    )
    return batchref
----
====


=== Unit of Work and Its Context Manager

In our tests we've implicitly defined an interface for what a unit
of work needs to do, let's make that explicit by using an abstract
base class:


[[abstract_unit_of_work]]
.Abstract Unit of Work context manager (src/allocation/service_layer/unit_of_work.py)
====
[source,python]
----
class AbstractUnitOfWork(abc.ABC):
    batches: repository.AbstractRepository  #<1>

    def __enter__(self) -> AbstractUnitOfWork:  #<2>
        return self  #<3>

    def __exit__(self, *args):  #<3>
        self.rollback()

    @abc.abstractmethod
    def commit(self):  #<4>
        raise NotImplementedError

    @abc.abstractmethod
    def rollback(self):  #<5>
        raise NotImplementedError
----
====

<1> The UoW provides an attribute called `.batches`, which will give us access
    to the batches repository.

<2> If you've never seen a context manager, `__enter__` and `__exit__` are
    the two magic methods that execute when we enter the `with` block and
    when we exit it.  They're our setup and teardown phases.

<3> The enter returns `self`, because we want access to the `uow` instance
    and its attributes and methods, inside the `with` block.

<4> It provides a way to explicitly commit our work

<5> If we don't commit, or if we exit the context manager by raising an error,
    we do a `rollback`. (the rollback has no effect if `commit()` has been
    called.  Read on for more discussion of this).


NOTE: We've made the UoW part of the service layer, in our folder
    hierarchy.  It is also an adapter, but as we'll see later in the
    book, it often takes on more service-layer responsibilities to do with
    domain events, so the service layer feels like the right place to us.


==== The Real Unit of Work Uses Sqlalchemy Sessions

The main thing that our concrete implementation adds is the
database session:

[[unit_of_work]]
.the real SQLAlchemy Unit of Work (src/allocation/service_layer/unit_of_work.py)
====
[source,python]
----
DEFAULT_SESSION_FACTORY = sessionmaker(bind=create_engine(  #<1>
    config.get_postgres_uri(),
))

class SqlAlchemyUnitOfWork(AbstractUnitOfWork):

    def __init__(self, session_factory=DEFAULT_SESSION_FACTORY):
        self.session_factory = session_factory  #<1>

    def __enter__(self):
        self.session = self.session_factory()  # type: Session  #<2>
        self.batches = repository.SqlAlchemyRepository(self.session)  #<2>
        return super().__enter__()

    def __exit__(self, *args):
        super().__exit__(*args)
        self.session.close()  #<3>

    def commit(self):  #<4>
        self.session.commit()

    def rollback(self):  #<4>
        self.session.rollback()

----
====

<1> The module defines a default session factory that will connect to postgres,
    but we allow that to be overriden in our integration tests, so that we
    can use SQLite instead.

<2> The dunder-enter is responsible for starting a database session, and instantiating
    a real repository that can use that session.

<3> We close the session on exit.

<4> Finally, we provide concrete `commit()` and `rollback()` methods that
    use our database session.

//TODO: why not swap out db using os.environ?
// (EJ2) Could be a good idea to point out that this couples the unit of work to postgres.
//         This does get dealt with in in bootstrap, so you could make a forward-reference.
// (EJ3) IIRC using a factory like this is considered an anti-pattern ("Control-Freak" from M.Seeman's book)
//         Is there a reason to inject a factory instead of a session?



=== Fake Unit of Work for Testing:

Here's how we use a fake Unit of Work in our service layer tests


[[fake_unit_of_work]]
.Fake unit of work (tests/unit/test_services.py)
====
[source,python]
----
class FakeUnitOfWork(unit_of_work.AbstractUnitOfWork):

    def __init__(self):
        self.batches = FakeRepository([])  #<1>
        self.committed = False  #<2>

    def commit(self):
        self.committed = True  #<2>

    def rollback(self):
        pass



def test_add_batch():
    uow = FakeUnitOfWork()  #<3>
    services.add_batch("b1", "CRUNCHY-ARMCHAIR", 100, None, uow)  #<3>
    assert uow.batches.get("b1") is not None
    assert uow.committed


def test_allocate_returns_allocation():
    uow = FakeUnitOfWork()  #<3>
    services.add_batch("batch1", "COMPLICATED-LAMP", 100, None, uow)  #<3>
    result = services.allocate("o1", "COMPLICATED-LAMP", 10, uow)  #<3>
    assert result == "batch1"
...
----
====

<1> `FakeUnitOfWork` and `FakeRepository` are tightly coupled,
    just like the real Unit of Work and Repository classes.
    That's fine because we recognize that the objects are collaborators.

<2> Notice the similarity with the fake `commit()` function
    from `FakeSession` (which we can now get rid of).  But it's
    a substantial improvement because we're now faking out
    code that we wrote, rather than 3rd party code.  Some
    people say https://github.com/testdouble/contributing-tests/wiki/Don%27t-mock-what-you-don%27t-own["don't mock what you don't own"].

<3> And in our tests, we can instantiate a UoW and pass it to
    our service layer, instead of a repository and a session,
    which is considerably less cumbersome.



////
TODO (BOB): Defend the mocking point

(EJ3):

https://github.com/cosmicpython/book/blame/master/chapter_05_uow.asciidoc#L238
Maybe "Only mock your immediate neighbors" is more applicable?

I think of "Don't mock what you don't own" as referring specifically to "mock verification" (e.g. assert mock_session.commit.assert_called_once()), with the reason for this advice being that you cannot change those interfaces. So the mock has no value in providing feedback to your design.

=== Using the UoW in the Service Layer

And here's what our new service layer looks like:


[[service_layer_with_uow]]
.Service layer using UoW (src/allocation/service_layer/services.py)
====
[source,python]
----
def add_batch(
        ref: str, sku: str, qty: int, eta: Optional[date],
        uow: unit_of_work.AbstractUnitOfWork  #<1>
):
    with uow:
        uow.batches.add(model.Batch(ref, sku, qty, eta))
        uow.commit()


def allocate(
        orderid: str, sku: str, qty: int,
        uow: unit_of_work.AbstractUnitOfWork  #<1>
) -> str:
    line = OrderLine(orderid, sku, qty)
    with uow:
        batches = uow.batches.list()
        if not is_valid_sku(line.sku, batches):
            raise InvalidSku(f'Invalid sku {line.sku}')
        batchref = model.allocate(line, batches)
        uow.commit()
    return batchref
----
====

<1> Our service layer now only has the one dependency, once again
    on an _abstract_ Unit of Work.


=== Explicit Tests for Commit/Rollback Behavior

To convince ourselves that the commit/rollback behavior works, we wrote
a couple of tests:

[[testing_rollback]]
.Integration tests for rollback behavior (tests/integration/test_uow.py)
====
[source,python]
----
def test_rolls_back_uncommitted_work_by_default(session_factory):
    uow = unit_of_work.SqlAlchemyUnitOfWork(session_factory)
    with uow:
        insert_batch(uow.session, 'batch1', 'MEDIUM-PLINTH', 100, None)

    new_session = session_factory()
    rows = list(new_session.execute('SELECT * FROM "batches"'))
    assert rows == []


def test_rolls_back_on_error(session_factory):
    class MyException(Exception):
        pass

    uow = unit_of_work.SqlAlchemyUnitOfWork(session_factory)
    with pytest.raises(MyException):
        with uow:
            insert_batch(uow.session, 'batch1', 'LARGE-FORK', 100, None)
            raise MyException()

    new_session = session_factory()
    rows = list(new_session.execute('SELECT * FROM "batches"'))
    assert rows == []
----
====

TIP: We haven't shown it here, but it can be worth testing some of the more
    "obscure" database behavior, like transactions, against the "real"
    database, ie the same engine.  For now we're getting away with using
    SQLite instead of Postgres, but in <<chapter_06_aggregate>> we'll switch
    some of the tests to using the real DB.  It's convenient that our UoW
    class makes that easy!


=== Explicit vs Implicit Commits

A brief digression on different ways of implementing the UoW pattern.

We could imagine a slightly different version of the UoW, which commits by default,
and only rolls back if it spots an exception:

[[uow_implicit_commit]]
.A UoW with implicit commit... (src/allocation/unit_of_work.py)
====
[source,python]
[role="skip"]
----

class AbstractUnitOfWork(abc.ABC):

    def __enter__(self):
        return self

    def __exit__(self, exn_type, exn_value, traceback):
        if exn_type is None:
            self.commit()  #<1>
        else:
            self.rollback()  #<2>
----
====

<1> should we have an implicit commit in the happy path?
<2> and roll back only on exception?

It would allow us to save a line of code, and remove the explicit commit from our
client code:

[[add_batch_nocommit]]
.\... would save us a line of code (src/allocation/service_layer/services.py)
====
[source,python]
[role="skip"]
----
def add_batch(ref: str, sku: str, qty: int, eta: Optional[date], uow):
    with uow:
        uow.batches.add(model.Batch(ref, sku, qty, eta))
        # uow.commit()
----
====

This is a judgement call, but we tend to prefer requiring the explicit commit
so that we have to choose when to flush state.

Although it's an extra line of code this makes the software safe-by-default.
The default behavior is to _not change anything_. In turn, that makes our code
easier to reason about because there's only one code path that leads to changes
in the system: total success and an explicit commit. Any other code path, any
exception, any early exit from the uow's scope, leads to a safe state.

Similarly, we prefer "always-rollback" to "only-rollback-on-error,"  because
the former feels easier to understand;  rollback rolls back to the last commit,
so either the user did one, or we blow their changes away.  Harsh but simple.



=== Examples: Using UoW to Group Multiple Operations Into an Atomic Unit

Here's a few examples showing the Unit of Work pattern in use.  You can
see how it leads to simple reasoning about what blocks of code happen
together:

==== Example 1: Reallocate

Supposing we want to be able to deallocate and then reallocate orders?

[[reallocate]]
.Reallocate service function
====
[source,python]
[role="skip"]
----
def reallocate(line: OrderLine, uow: AbstractUnitOfWork) -> str:
    with uow:
        batch = uow.batches.get(sku=line.sku)
        if batch is None:
            raise InvalidSku(f'Invalid sku {line.sku}')
        batch.deallocate(line)  #<1>
        allocate(line)  #<2>
        uow.commit()
----
====

<1> If `deallocate()` fails, we don't want to do `allocate()`, obviously.
<2> But if `allocate()` fails, we probably don't want to actually commit
    the `deallocate()`, either.


==== Example 2: Change Batch Quantity

Our shipping company gives us a call to say that one of the container doors
opened and half our sofas have fallen into the Indian Ocean.  Oops!


[[change_batch_quantity]]
.Change quantity
====
[source,python]
[role="skip"]
----
def change_batch_quantity(batchref: str, new_qty: int, uow: AbstractUnitOfWork):
    with uow:
        batch = uow.batches.get(reference=batchref)
        batch.change_purchased_quantity(new_qty)
        while batch.available_quantity < 0:
            line = batch.deallocate_one()  #<1>
        uow.commit()
----
====

<1> Here we may need to deallocate any number of lines.  If we get a failure
    at any stage, we probably want to commit none of the changes.


=== Tidying Up the Integration Tests

We now have three sets of tests all essentially pointing at the database,
_test_orm.py_, _test_repository.py_ and _test_uow.py_.  Should we throw any
away?

====
[source,text]
[role="tree"]
----
└── tests
    ├── conftest.py
    ├── e2e
    │   └── test_api.py
    ├── integration
    │   ├── test_orm.py
    │   ├── test_repository.py
    │   └── test_uow.py
    ├── pytest.ini
    └── unit
        ├── test_allocate.py
        ├── test_batches.py
        └── test_services.py

----
====

You should always feel free to throw away tests if you feel they're not going to
add value, longer term.  We'd say that _test_orm.py_ was primarily a tool to help
us learn SQLAlchemy, so we won't need that long term, especially if the main things
it's doing are covered in _test_repository.py_.  That last you might keep around,
but we could certainly see an argument for just keeping everything at the highest
possible level of abstraction (just as we did for the unit tests).

// TODO: expand on this a bit?


.Exercise for the Reader
******************************************************************************
For this chapter, probably the best thing to do is try to implement a
UoW from scratch.  You could either follow the model we have quite closely,
or perhaps experiment with separating the UoW (whose responsibilities are
`commit()`, `rollback()` and providing the `.batches` repository) from the
context manager, whose job is to initialize things, and then do the commit
or rollback on exit.  If you feel like going all-functional rather than
messing about with all these classes, you could use `@contextmanager` from
`contextlib`.

https://github.com/cosmicpython/code/tree/chapter_05_uow_exercise

We've stripped out both the actual UoW and the fakes, as well as paring back
the abstract UoW.  Why not send us a link to your repo if you come up with
something you're particularly proud of?

******************************************************************************


=== Wrap-Up

Hopefully we've convinced you that the Unit of Work is a useful pattern, and
hopefully you'll agree that the context manager is a really nice Pythonic way
of visually grouping code into blocks that we want to happen atomically.

This pattern is so useful, in fact, that SQLAlchemy already uses a unit-of-work
in the shape of the Session object. The Session object in SQLAlchemy is the way
that your application loads data from the database.

Every time you load a new entity from the database, the Session begins to _track_
changes to the entity, and when the Session is _flushed_, all your changes are
persisted together.

Why do we go to the effort of abstracting away the SQLAlchemy session if it
already implements the pattern we want?

For one thing, the Session API is rich and supports operations that we don't
want or need in our domain. Our `UnitOfWork` simplifies the Session to its
essential core: it can be started, committed, or thrown away.

For another, we're using the `UnitOfWork` to access our `Repository` objects.
This is a neat bit of developer usability that we couldn't do with a plain
SQLAlchemy Session.

Lastly, we're motivated again by the dependency inversion principle: our
service layer depends on a thin abstraction, and we attach a concrete
implementation at the outside edge of the system. This lines up nicely with
SQLAlchemy's own recommendations:

> Keep the lifecycle of the session (and usually the transaction) separate and
> external.
> The most comprehensive approach, recommended for more substantial applications,
> will try to keep the details of session, transaction and exception management
> as far as possible from the details of the program doing its work.


//TODO:  not sure where, but we should maybe talk about the option of separating
// the uow into a uow plus a uowm.


.Unit of Work Pattern: Wrap-up
*****************************************************************
Unit of Work is an abstraction around data integrity::
    It helps to enforce the consistency of our domain model, and improves
    performance, by letting us perform a single _flush_ operation at the
    end of an operation.

It works closely with the Repository and Service Layer::
    The Unit of Work pattern completes our abstractions over data-access by
    representing atomic updates. Each of our service-layer use-cases runs in a
    single unit of work which succeeds or fails as a block.

This is a lovely case for a context manager::
    Context managers are an idiomatic way of defining scope in Python. We can use a
    context manager to automatically rollback our work at the end of request
    which means the system is safe by default.

SQLAlchemy already implements this pattern::
    We introduce an even simpler abstraction over the SQLAlchemy Session object
    in order to "narrow" the interface between the ORM and our code. This helps
    to keep us loosely coupled.

.Unit of Work: The Trade-Offs
|===
|Pros|Cons
a|
* We've got a nice abstraction over the concept of atomic operations, and the
  context manager makes it very easy to see, visually, what blocks of code are
  grouped together atomically.

* We have explicit control over when a transaction starts and finishes, and our
  application fails in a way that is safe by default. We never have to worry
  that an operation is partially committed.

* It's a nice place to put all your repositories so client code can access it

* And we'll see in later chapters, atomicity isn't only about transactions, it
  can help us to work with events and the message bus.

a|
* Your ORM probably already has some perfectly good abstractions around
  atomicity.  SQLAlchemy even has context managers. You can go a long way
  just passing a Session around.

* We've made it look easy, but you actually have to think quite carefully about
  things like rollbacks, multithreading, and nested transactions.  Perhaps just
  sticking to what Django or Flask-SQLAlchemy gives you will keep your life
  simpler.
