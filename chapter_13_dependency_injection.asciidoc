== Dependency Injection (and Bootstrapping)

Dependency injection (DI) is regarded with suspicion in the Python world.  And
we've managed _just fine_ without it so far in the example code for this
book!

In this chapter, we'll explore some of the pain points in our code
that lead us to consider using DI, and we'll present some options
for how to do it, leaving it to you to pick which you think is most Pythonic.

We'll also add a new component to our architecture called __bootstrap.py__;
it will be in charge of dependency injection, and some other initialization
stuff that we often need.  We'll explain why this sort of thing is called
a _composition root_ in OO languages, and why _bootstrap script_ is just fine
for our purposes.

<<bootstrap_chapter_before_diagram>> shows what our app looks like without
a bootstrapper: the entrypoints do a lot of initialization and passing around
of our main dependency, the UoW.

=== Implicit Versus Explicit Dependencies

Depending on your particular brain type, you may have already had a slight
feeling of unease at the back of your mind at this point.  Let's bring it out
into the open. We've currently shown two ways of managing
dependencies and testing them.

[TIP]

The code for this chapter is in the
https://github.com/cosmicpython/code/tree/chapter_13_dependency_injection[chapter_13_dependency_injection] branch on GitHub.

[TIP]
====
If you haven't already, it's worth reading <<chapter_03_abstractions>>
    before continuing with this chapter, particularly the discussion of
    functional versus object-oriented dependency management.
====

For our database dependency, we've built a careful framework of explicit
dependencies and easy options for overriding them in tests. Our main handler
functions declare an explicit dependency on the UoW:

[[existing_handler]]
.Our handlers have an explicit dependency on the UoW (src/allocation/service_layer/handlers.py)
====
[source,python]
[role="existing"]
----
def allocate(
        cmd: commands.Allocate, uow: unit_of_work.AbstractUnitOfWork
):
----
====

And that makes it easy to swap in a fake UoW in our
service-layer tests:

[[existing_services_test]]
.Service layer tests against a fake UoW: (tests/unit/test_services.py)
====
[source,python]
[role="skip"]
----
    uow = FakeUnitOfWork()
    messagebus.handle([...], uow)
----
====


The UoW itself declares an explicit dependency on the session factory:


[[existing_uow]]
.The UoW depends on a session factory (src/allocation/service_layer/unit_of_work.py)
====
[source,python]
[role="existing"]
----
class SqlAlchemyUnitOfWork(AbstractUnitOfWork):

    def __init__(self, session_factory=DEFAULT_SESSION_FACTORY):
        self.session_factory = session_factory
        ...
----
====

We take advantage of it in our integration tests to be able to use SQLite
instead of Postgres, sometimes:

[[existing_integration_test]]
.Integration tests against a different DB (tests/integration/test_uow.py)
====
[source,python]
[role="existing"]
----
def test_rolls_back_uncommitted_work_by_default(sqlite_session_factory):
    uow = unit_of_work.SqlAlchemyUnitOfWork(sqlite_session_factory)  #<1>
----
====

<1> Integration tests swap out the default Postgres `session_factory` for a
    SQLite one.



=== Aren't Explicit Dependencies Totally Weird and Java-y?

If you're used to the way things normally happen in Python, you'll be thinking
all this is a bit weird.  The standard way to do things is to declare our
dependency implicitly by simply importing it, and then if we ever need to
change it for tests, we can monkeypatch, as is Right and True in dynamic
languages:


[[normal_implicit_dependency]]
.Email sending as a normal import-based dependency (src/allocation/service_layer/handlers.py)
====
[source,python]
[role="existing"]
----
from allocation.adapters import email, redis_eventpublisher  #<1>
...

def send_out_of_stock_notification(
        event: events.OutOfStock, uow: unit_of_work.AbstractUnitOfWork,
):
    email.send(  #<2>
        'stock@made.com',
        f'Out of stock for {event.sku}',
    )
----
====

<1> Hardcoded import
<2> Calls specific email sender directly


Why pollute our application code with unnecessary arguments just for the
sake of our tests? `mock.patch` makes monkeypatching nice and easy:


[[mocking_is_easy]]
.mock dot patch, thank you Michael Foord (tests/unit/test_handlers.py)
====
[source,python]
[role="existing"]
----
    with mock.patch("allocation.adapters.email.send") as mock_send_mail:
        ...
----
====

The trouble is that we've made it look easy because our toy example doesn't
send real email (`email.send_mail` just does a `print`), but in real life,
you'd end up having to call `mock.patch` for _every single test_ that might
cause an out-of-stock notification. If you've worked on codebases with lots of
mocks used to prevent unwanted side effects, you'll know how annoying that
mocky boilerplate gets.

And, you'll know that mocks tightly couple us to the implementation. By
choosing to monkeypatch `email.send_mail`, we are tied to doing `import email`,
and if we ever want to do `from email import send_mail`, a trivial refactor,
we'd have to change all our mocks.

So it's a trade-off. Yes, declaring explicit dependencies is unnecessary,
strictly speaking, and using them would make our application code marginally
more complex. But in return, we'd get tests that are easier to write and
manage.

On top of that, declaring an explicit dependency is an example of the
dependency inversion principle—rather than having an (implicit) dependency on
a _specific_ detail, we have an (explicit) dependency on an _abstraction_:

[quote, The Zen of Python]
____
Explicit is better than implicit
____


[[handler_with_explicit_dependency]]
.The explicit dependency is more abstract (src/allocation/service_layer/handlers.py)
====
[source,python]
[role="non-head"]
----
def send_out_of_stock_notification(
        event: events.OutOfStock, send_mail: Callable,
):
    send_mail(
        'stock@made.com',
        f'Out of stock for {event.sku}',
    )
----
====

But if we do change to declaring all these dependencies explicitly, who will
inject them and how? So far, we've really been dealing with only passing the
UoW around: our tests use `FakeUnitOfWork`, while Flask and Redis event-consumer
entrypoints use the real UoW, and the message bus passes them onto our command
handlers. If we add real and fake email classes, who will create them and
pass them on?

That's extra (duplicated) cruft for Flask, Redis, and our tests. Moreover,
putting all the responsibility for passing dependencies to the right handler
onto the message bus feels like a violation of the SRP.

Instead, we'll reach for a pattern called _Composition Root_ (a bootstrap
script to you and me)footnote:[Because Python is not a "pure" OO language, Python developers aren't necessarily used to the concept of needing to _compose_ a set of objects into a working application. We just pick our entrypoint and run code from top to bottom.],
and we'll do a bit of "manual DI" (dependency injection without a
framework):footnote:[Mark Seemann calls this https://oreil.ly/iGpDL[_Pure DI_] or sometimes _Vanilla DI_.]

//TODO: betterify diagram? or just get rid of, in favour of the first?




=== Preparing Handlers: Manual DI with Closures and Partials

One way to turn a function with dependencies into one that's ready to be
called later with those dependencies _already injected_, is to use closures or
partial functions to compose the function with its dependencies:


[[di_with_partial_functions_examples]]
.Examples of DI using closures or partial functions
====
[source,python]
[role="skip"]
----
# existing allocate function, with abstract uow dependency
def allocate(
        cmd: commands.Allocate, uow: unit_of_work.AbstractUnitOfWork
):
    line = OrderLine(cmd.orderid, cmd.sku, cmd.qty)
    with uow:
        ...

# bootstrap script prepares actual UoW

def bootstrap(..):
    uow = unit_of_work.SqlAlchemyUnitOfWork()

    # then prepares a version of the allocate fn with UoW dependency captured in a closure
    allocate_composed = lambda cmd: allocate(cmd, uow)

    # or, equivalently (this gets you a nicer stack trace)
    def allocate_composed(cmd):
        return allocate(cmd, uow)

    # alternatively with a partial
    import functools
    allocate_composed = functools.partial(allocate, uow=uow)  #<1>

# later at runtime, we can call the partial function, and it will have
# the UoW already bound
allocate_composed(cmd)
----
====

<1> The difference between closures (lambdas or named functions) and
    `functools.partial` is that the former use
    https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/gotchas/#late-binding-closures[late
    binding of variables], which can be a source of confusion if
    any of the dependencies are mutable.

Here's the same pattern again for the `send_out_of_stock_notification()` handler,
which has different dependencies:

[[partial_functions_2]]
.Another closure and partial functions example
====
[source,python]
[role="skip"]
----
def send_out_of_stock_notification(
        event: events.OutOfStock, send_mail: Callable,
):
    send_mail(
        'stock@made.com',
        ...


# prepare a version of the send_out_of_stock_notification with dependencies
sosn_composed  = lambda event: send_out_of_stock_notification(event, email.send_mail)

...
# later, at runtime:
sosn_composed(event)  # will have email.send_mail already injected in
----
====


=== An Alternative Using Classes

Closures and partial functions will feel familiar to people who've done a bit
of functional programming. Here's an alternative using classes, which may
appeal to others. It requires rewriting all our handler functions as
classes, though:

[[di_with_classes]]
.DI using classes
====
[source,python]
[role="skip"]
----
# we replace the old `def allocate(cmd, uow)` with:

class AllocateHandler:

    def __init__(self, uow: unit_of_work.AbstractUnitOfWork):  #<2>
        self.uow = uow

    def __call__(self, cmd: commands.Allocate):  #<1>
        line = OrderLine(cmd.orderid, cmd.sku, cmd.qty)
        with self.uow:
            # rest of handler method as before
            ...

# bootstrap script prepares actual UoW
uow = unit_of_work.SqlAlchemyUnitOfWork()

# then prepares a version of the allocate fn with dependencies already injected
allocate = AllocateHandler(uow)

...
# later at runtime, we can call the handler instance, and it will have
# the UoW already injected
allocate(cmd)
----
====

<1> The class is designed to produce a callable function, so it has a
    +++<code>call</code>+++ method.

<2> But we use the +++<code>init</code>+++ to declare the dependencies it
    requires. This sort of thing will feel familiar if you've ever made
    class-based descriptors, or a class-based context manager that takes
    arguments.


Use whichever you and your team feel more comfortable with.


=== A Bootstrap Script


We want our bootstrap script to do the following:

1. Declare default dependencies but allow us to override them
2. Do the "init" stuff that we need to get our app started
3. Inject all the dependencies into our handlers
4. Give us back the core object for our app, the message bus

Here's a first cut:


[[bootstrap_script]]
.A bootstrap function (src/allocation/bootstrap.py)
====
[source,python]
[role="non-head"]
----
def bootstrap(
    start_orm: bool = True,  #<1>
    uow: unit_of_work.AbstractUnitOfWork = unit_of_work.SqlAlchemyUnitOfWork(),  #<2>
    send_mail: Callable = email.send,
    publish: Callable = redis_eventpublisher.publish,
) -> messagebus.MessageBus:

    if start_orm:
        orm.start_mappers()  #<1>

    dependencies = {'uow': uow, 'send_mail': send_mail, 'publish': publish}
    injected_event_handlers = {  #<3>
        event_type: [
            inject_dependencies(handler, dependencies)
            for handler in event_handlers
        ]
        for event_type, event_handlers in handlers.EVENT_HANDLERS.items()
    }
    injected_command_handlers = {  #<3>
        command_type: inject_dependencies(handler, dependencies)
        for command_type, handler in handlers.COMMAND_HANDLERS.items()
    }

    return messagebus.MessageBus(  #<4>
        uow=uow,
        event_handlers=injected_event_handlers,
        command_handlers=injected_command_handlers,
    )
----
====

<1> `orm.start_mappers()` is our example of initialization work that needs
    to be done once at the beginning of an app. We also see things like
    setting up the `logging` module.

<2> We can use the argument defaults to define what the normal/production
    defaults are. It's nice to have them in a single place, but
    sometimes dependencies have some side-effects at construction-time,
    in which case you might prefer to default them to `None` instead.

<3> We build up our injected versions of the handler mappings by using
    a function called `inject_dependencies()` which we'll show next.

<4> We return a configured message bus ready to use.

// TODO more examples of init stuff

// IDEA: show option of bootstrapper as class instead?

Here's how we inject dependencies into a handler function by inspecting
it:

[[di_by_inspection]]
.DI by inspecting function signatures (src/allocation/bootstrap.py)
====
[source,python]
----
def inject_dependencies(handler, dependencies):
    params = inspect.signature(handler).parameters  #<1>
    deps = {
        name: dependency
        for name, dependency in dependencies.items()  #<2>
        if name in params
    }
    return lambda message: handler(message, **deps)  #<3>
----
====

<1> We inspect our command/event handler's arguments.
<2> We match them by name to our dependencies.
<3> We inject them in as kwargs to produce a partial.


.Even-More-Manual DI with Less Magic
*******************************************************************************
If you're finding the preceding `inspect` code a little harder to grok, this
even-simpler version may appeal to you.

Harry wrote the code for `inject_dependencies()` as a first cut of how to do
"manual" dependency injection, and when he saw it, Bob accused him of
overengineering and writing his own DI framework.

It honestly didn't even occur to Harry that you could do it any more plainly,
but you can, like this:

// (EJ3) I don't know if I'd even call this DI, it's just straight meta-programming.

[[nomagic_di]]

    injected_event_handlers = {
        events.Allocated: [
            lambda e: handlers.publish_allocated_event(e, publish),
            lambda e: handlers.add_allocation_to_read_model(e, uow),
        ],
        events.Deallocated: [
            lambda e: handlers.remove_allocation_from_read_model(e, uow),
            lambda e: handlers.reallocate(e, uow),
        ],
        events.OutOfStock: [
            lambda e: handlers.send_out_of_stock_notification(e, send_mail)
        ]
    }
    injected_command_handlers = {
        commands.Allocate: lambda c: handlers.allocate(c, uow),
        commands.CreateBatch: \
            lambda c: handlers.add_batch(c, uow),
        commands.ChangeBatchQuantity: \
            lambda c: handlers.change_batch_quantity(c, uow),
    }
----
====

Harry says he couldn't even imagine writing out that many lines of code
and having to look up that many function arguments manually.
This is a perfectly viable solution, though, since it's only one
line of code or so per handler you add, so not a massive maintenance burden
even if you have dozens of handlers.

Our app is structured in such a way that we always want to do dependency
injection in only one place, the handler functions, so this super-manual solution
and Harry's `inspect()`-based one will both work fine.

If you find yourself wanting to do DI in more things and at different times,
or if you ever get into _dependency chains_ (where your dependencies have their
own dependencies, and so on), you may get some mileage out of a "real" DI
framework.

// IDEA: discuss/define what a DI container is

At MADE, we've used https://pypi.org/project/Inject[Inject] in a few places,
and it's fine although it makes Pylint unhappy.  You might also check out

DRY-Python crew's https://github.com/dry-python/dependencies[dependencies].

*******************************************************************************


=== Message Bus Is Given Handlers at Runtime

Our message bus will no longer be static; it needs to have the already-injected
handlers given to it. So we turn it from being a module into a configurable
class:


[[messagebus_as_class]]
.MessageBus as a class (src/allocation/service_layer/messagebus.py)
====
[source,python]
[role="non-head"]
----
class MessageBus:  #<1>

    def __init__(
        self,
        uow: unit_of_work.AbstractUnitOfWork,
        event_handlers: Dict[Type[events.Event], List[Callable]],  #<2>
        command_handlers: Dict[Type[commands.Command], Callable],  #<2>
    ):
        self.uow = uow
        self.event_handlers = event_handlers
        self.command_handlers = command_handlers

    def handle(self, message: Message):  #<3>
        self.queue = [message]  #<4>
        while self.queue:
            message = self.queue.pop(0)
            if isinstance(message, events.Event):
                self.handle_event(message)
            elif isinstance(message, commands.Command):
                self.handle_command(message)
            else:
                raise Exception(f'{message} was not an Event or Command')
----
====

<1> The message bus becomes a class...
<2> ...which is given its already-dependency-injected handlers.
<3> The main `handle()` function is substantially the same, just
    moving a few attributes and methods onto `self`.
<4> Using `self.queue` like this is not thread-safe, which might
    be a problem if you're using threads, because the bus instance is global
    in the Flask app context, as we've written it. Just something to watch out for.


What else changes in the bus?

[[messagebus_handlers_change]]
.Event and command handler logic stays the same (src/allocation/service_layer/messagebus.py)
====
[source,python]
----
    def handle_event(self, event: events.Event):
        for handler in self.event_handlers[type(event)]:  #<1>
            try:
                logger.debug('handling event %s with handler %s', event, handler)
                handler(event)  #<2>
                self.queue.extend(self.uow.collect_new_events())
            except Exception:
                logger.exception('Exception handling event %s', event)
                continue


    def handle_command(self, command: commands.Command):
        logger.debug('handling command %s', command)
        try:
            handler = self.command_handlers[type(command)]  #<1>
            handler(command)  #<2>
            self.queue.extend(self.uow.collect_new_events())
        except Exception:
            logger.exception('Exception handling command %s', command)
            raise
----
====

<1> `handle_event` and `handle_command` are substantially the same, but instead
    of indexing into a static `EVENT_HANDLERS` or `COMMAND_HANDLERS` dict, they
    use the versions on `self`.

<2> Instead of passing a UoW into the handler, we expect the handlers
    to already have all their dependencies, so all they need is a single argument,
    the specific event or command.


=== Using Bootstrap in Our Entrypoints

In our application's entrypoints, we now just call `bootstrap.bootstrap()`
and get a message bus that's ready to go, rather than configuring a UoW and the
rest of it:

[[flask_calls_bootstrap]]
.Flask calls bootstrap (src/allocation/entrypoints/flask_app.py)
====
[source,diff]
----
-from allocation import views
+from allocation import bootstrap, views

 app = Flask(__name__)
-orm.start_mappers()  #<1>
+bus = bootstrap.bootstrap()


 @app.route("/add_batch", methods=['POST'])
@@ -19,8 +16,7 @@ def add_batch():
     cmd = commands.CreateBatch(
         request.json['ref'], request.json['sku'], request.json['qty'], eta,

-    uow = unit_of_work.SqlAlchemyUnitOfWork()  #<2>
-    messagebus.handle(cmd, uow)
+    bus.handle(cmd)  #<3>
     return 'OK', 201

----
====

<1> We no longer need to call `start_orm()`: the bootstrap script's initialization
    stages will do that.

<2> We no longer need to explicitly build a particular type of UoW; the bootstrap
    script defaults take care of it.

<3> And our message bus is now a specific instance rather than the global module.footnote:[
    However, it's still a global in the `flask_app` module scope, if that makes sense. This
    may cause problems if you ever find yourself wanting to test your Flask app
    in-process by using the Flask Test Client instead of using Docker as we do.
    It's worth researching https://oreil.ly/_a6Kl[Flask app factories]
    if you get into this.]


=== Initializing DI in Our Tests

In tests, we can use `bootstrap.bootstrap()` with overridden defaults to get a
custom message bus. Here's an example in an integration test:


[[bootstrap_view_tests]]
.Overriding bootstrap defaults (tests/integration/test_views.py)
====
[source,python]
[role="non-head"]
----
@pytest.fixture
def sqlite_bus(sqlite_session_factory):
    bus = bootstrap.bootstrap(
        start_orm=True,  #<1>
        uow=unit_of_work.SqlAlchemyUnitOfWork(sqlite_session_factory),  #<2>
        send_mail=lambda *args: None,  #<3>
        publish=lambda *args: None,  #<3>
    )
    yield bus
    clear_mappers()

def test_allocations_view(sqlite_bus):
    sqlite_bus.handle(commands.CreateBatch('sku1batch', 'sku1', 50, None))
    sqlite_bus.handle(commands.CreateBatch('sku2batch', 'sku2', 50, date.today()))
    ...
    assert views.allocations('order1', sqlite_bus.uow) == [
        {'sku': 'sku1', 'batchref': 'sku1batch'},
        {'sku': 'sku2', 'batchref': 'sku2batch'},
    ]
----
====

<1> We do still want to start the ORM...
<2> ...because we're going to use a real UoW, albeit with an in-memory database.
<3> But we don't need to send email or publish, so we make those noops.


In our unit tests, in contrast, we can reuse our `FakeUnitOfWork`:

[[bootstrap_tests]]
.Bootstrap in unit test (tests/unit/test_handlers.py)
====
[source,python]
[role="non-head"]
----
def bootstrap_test_app():
    return bootstrap.bootstrap(
        start_orm=False,  #<1>
        uow=FakeUnitOfWork(),  #<2>
        send_mail=lambda *args: None,  #<3>
        publish=lambda *args: None,  #<3>
    )
----
====

<1> No need to start the ORM...
<2> ...because the fake UoW doesn't use one.
<3> We want to fake out our email and Redis adapters too.


So that gets rid of a little duplication, and we've moved a bunch
of setup and sensible defaults into a single place.


.Exercise for the Reader 1
**********************************************************************
Change all the handlers to being classes as per <<di_with_classes>>,
and amend the bootstrapper's DI code as appropriate.  This will let you
know if you prefer the functional or the class-based approach, when
it comes to your own projects.
**********************************************************************


=== Building an Adapter "Properly": A Worked Example

To really get a feel for how it all works, let's work through an example of how
you might build an adapter, and do dependency injection for it, "properly."

At the moment, we have two types of dependencies:

[[two_types_of_dependency]]
.Two types of dependencies (src/allocation/service_layer/messagebus.py)
====
[source,python]

----
    uow: unit_of_work.AbstractUnitOfWork,  #<1>

    publish: Callable,  #<2>
----
====

<1> The UoW has an abstract base class. This is the heavyweight
    option for declaring and managing your external dependency.
    We'd use this for the case when the dependency is relatively complex.

<2> Our email sender and pub/sub publisher are defined
    as functions. This works just fine for simple dependencies.

Here are some of the things we find ourselves injecting at work:

* An S3 filesystem client
* A key/value store client
* A `requests` session object

Most of these will have more-complex APIs that you can't capture
as a single function. Read and write, GET and POST, and so on.

Even though it's simple, let's use `send_mail` as an example to talk
through how you might define a more complex dependency.


==== Define the Abstract and Concrete Implementations

We'll imagine a more generic notifications API. Could be
email, could be SMS, could be slack posts one day.


[[notifications_dot_py]]
.An ABC and a concrete implementation (src/allocation/adapters/notifications.py)
====
[source,python]
----
class AbstractNotifications(abc.ABC):

    @abc.abstractmethod
    def send(self, destination, message):
        raise NotImplementedError

...

class EmailNotifications(AbstractNotifications):

    def __init__(self, smtp_host=DEFAULT_HOST, port=DEFAULT_PORT):
        self.server = smtplib.SMTP(smtp_host, port=port)
        self.server.noop()

    def send(self, destination, message):
        msg = f'Subject: allocation service notification\n{message}'
        self.server.sendmail(
            from_addr='allocations@example.com',
            to_addrs=[destination],
            msg=msg
        )
----
====


We change the dependency in the bootstrap script:

[[notifications_in_bus]]
.Notifications in message bus (src/allocation/bootstrap.py)
====
[source,diff]
[role="skip"]
----
 def bootstrap(
     start_orm: bool = True,
     uow: unit_of_work.AbstractUnitOfWork = unit_of_work.SqlAlchemyUnitOfWork(),
-    send_mail: Callable = email.send,
+    notifications: AbstractNotifications = EmailNotifications(),
     publish: Callable = redis_eventpublisher.publish,
 ) -> messagebus.MessageBus:
----
====


==== Make a Fake Version for Your Tests

We work through and define a fake version for unit testing:


[[fake_notifications]]
.Fake notifications (tests/unit/test_handlers.py)
====
[source,python]
----
class FakeNotifications(notifications.AbstractNotifications):

    def __init__(self):
        self.sent = defaultdict(list)  # type: Dict[str, List[str]]

    def send(self, destination, message):
        self.sent[destination].append(message)
...
----
====

And we use it in our tests:

[[test_with_fake_notifs]]
.Tests change slightly (tests/unit/test_handlers.py)
====
[source,python]
----
    def test_sends_email_on_out_of_stock_error(self):
        fake_notifs = FakeNotifications()
        bus = bootstrap.bootstrap(
            start_orm=False,
            uow=FakeUnitOfWork(),
            notifications=fake_notifs,
            publish=lambda *args: None,
        )
        bus.handle(commands.CreateBatch("b1", "POPULAR-CURTAINS", 9, None))
        bus.handle(commands.Allocate("o1", "POPULAR-CURTAINS", 10))
        assert fake_notifs.sent['stock@made.com'] == [
            f"Out of stock for POPULAR-CURTAINS",
        ]
----
====


==== Figure Out How to Integration Test the Real Thing

Now we test the real thing, usually with an end-to-end or integration
test.  We've used https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog[MailHog] as a
real-ish email server for our Docker dev environment:


[[docker_compose_with_mailhog]]
.Docker-compose config with real fake email server (docker-compose.yml)
====
[source,yaml]
----
version: "3"

services:

  redis_pubsub:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    image: allocation-image
    ...

  api:
    image: allocation-image
    ...

  postgres:
    image: postgres:9.6
    ...

  redis:
    image: redis:alpine
    ...

  mailhog:
    image: mailhog/mailhog
    ports:
      - "11025:1025"
      - "18025:8025"
----
====


In our integration tests, we use the real `EmailNotifications` class,
talking to the MailHog server in the Docker cluster:


[[integration_test_email]]
.Integration test for email (tests/integration/test_email.py)
====
[source,python]
----
@pytest.fixture
def bus(sqlite_session_factory):
    bus = bootstrap.bootstrap(
        start_orm=True,
        uow=unit_of_work.SqlAlchemyUnitOfWork(sqlite_session_factory),
        notifications=notifications.EmailNotifications(),  #<1>
        publish=lambda *args: None,
    )
    yield bus
    clear_mappers()


def get_email_from_mailhog(sku):  #<2>
    host, port = map(config.get_email_host_and_port().get, ['host', 'http_port'])
    all_emails = requests.get(f'http://{host}:{port}/api/v2/messages').json()
    return next(m for m in all_emails['items'] if sku in str(m))


def test_out_of_stock_email(bus):
    sku = random_sku()
    bus.handle(commands.CreateBatch('batch1', sku, 9, None))  #<3>
    bus.handle(commands.Allocate('order1', sku, 10))
    email = get_email_from_mailhog(sku)
    assert email['Raw']['From'] == 'allocations@example.com'  #<4>
    assert email['Raw']['To'] == ['stock@made.com']
    assert f'Out of stock for {sku}' in email['Raw']['Data']
----
====

<1> We use our bootstrapper to build a message bus that talks to the
    real notifications class.
<2> We figure out how to fetch emails from our "real" email server.
<3> We use the bus to do our test setup.
<4> Against all the odds, this actually worked, pretty much at the first go!


And that's it really.

.DI and Bootstrap Recap
****
* Once you have more than one adapter, you'll start to feel a lot of pain
  from passing dependencies around manually, unless you do some kind of
  _dependency injection._

* Setting up dependency injection is just one of many typical
  setup/initialization activities that you need to do just once when starting
  your app.  Putting this all together into a _bootstrap script_ is often a
  good idea.

* The bootstrap script is also a good place to provide sensible default
  configuration for your adapters, and as a single place to override those
  adapters with fakes, for your tests.

* A dependency injection framework can be useful if you find yourself
  needing to do DI at multiple levels: if you have chained dependencies
  of components that all need DI, for example.

* This chapter also presented a worked example of changing an implicit/simple
  dependency into a "proper" adapter, factoring out an ABC, defining its real
  and fake implementations, and thinking through integration testing.
****

In summary:

1. Define your API using an ABC.
2. Implement the real thing.
3. Build a fake and use it for unit/service-layer/handler tests.
4. Find a less-fake version you can put into your Docker environment.
5. Test the less-fake "real" thing.
6. Profit!

.Exercise for the Reader 2
******************************************************************************

You could do two things for practice regarding adapters:

1. Try swapping out our notifications from email to, for example, SMS
    notifications using Twilio, or Slack notifications.  Can you find
    a good equivalent to MailHog for integration testing?

2. In a similar way to what we did moving from `send_mail` to a `Notifications`
    class, try refactoring our `redis_eventpublisher` that is currently just
    a `Callable` to some sort of more formal adapter/base class/protocol.
