== Events and the Message Bus

So far we've spent a lot of time and energy on a simple problem that we could
easily have solved with Django. You might be asking if the increased testability
and expressiveness are _really_ worth all the effort.

In practice, though, we find that it's not the obvious features that make a mess
of our codebases: it's the goop around the edge. It's reporting, and permissions
and workflows that touch a zillion objects.

Our example will be a typical notification requirement:  when we can't allocate
an order because we're out of stock, we should alert the buying team. They'll
go and fix the problem by buying more stock, and all will be well.

For a first version, our product owner says we can just send the alert by email.

Let's see how our architecture holds up once we need to plug in some of the
mundane stuff that makes up so much of our systems.

We'll start by doing the simplest, most expeditious thing, and talk about
why it's exactly this kind of decision that leads us to Big Ball of Mud.

Then we'll show how to use _Domain Events_ to separate side-effects from our
use cases, and how to build a simple _Message Bus_ for triggering behavior
based on those events.  We'll show a few different options for creating
those events and how to pass them to the message bus, and finally we'll show
how the Unit of Work can be modified to connect the two together elegantly,
as previewed in <<message_bus_diagram>>.

=== Avoiding Making a Mess.

So.  Email alerts when we run out of stock. When we have a new requirement like
this, that's not _really_ to do with the core domain, it's all too easy to
start dumping these things into our web controllers:


==== First, Avoid Making a Mess of of Our Web Controllers

[[email_in_flask]]
.Just whack it in the endpoint, what could go wrong? (src/allocation/entrypoints/flask_app.py)
====
[source,python]
[role="skip"]
----
@app.route("/allocate", methods=['POST'])
def allocate_endpoint():
    line = model.OrderLine(
        request.json['orderid'],
        request.json['sku'],
        request.json['qty'],
    )
    try:
        uow = unit_of_work.SqlAlchemyUnitOfWork()
        batchref = services.allocate(line, uow)
    except (model.OutOfStock, services.InvalidSku) as e:
        send_mail(
            'out of stock',
            'stock_admin@made.com',
            f'{line.orderid} - {line.sku}'
        )
        return jsonify({'message': str(e)}), 400

    return jsonify({'batchref': batchref}), 201
----
====

As a one-off hack, this might be okay, but it's easy to see how we can quickly
end up in a mess by patching things in this way. Sending emails isn't the job of
our HTTP layer, and we'd like to be able to unit test this new feature.


==== ... And Let's Not Make a Mess of Our Model Either

Assuming we don't want to put this code into our web controllers, because
we want them to be as thin as possible, we may look at putting it right at
the source, in the model:

[[email_in_model]]
.Email-sending code in our model isn't lovely either (src/allocation/domain/model.py)
====
[source,python]
[role="non-head"]
----
    def allocate(self, line: OrderLine) -> str:
        try:
            batch = next(
                b for b in sorted(self.batches) if b.can_allocate(line)
            )
            #...
        except StopIteration:
            email.send_mail('stock@made.com', f'Out of stock for {line.sku}')
            raise OutOfStock(f'Out of stock for sku {line.sku}')
----
====

But that's even worse!  We don't want our model to have any dependencies on
infrastructure concerns like `email.send_mail`.

This email sending thing is unwelcome _goop_ messing up the nice clean flow
of our system. What we'd like is to keep our domain model focused on the rule
"You can't allocate more stuff than is actually available."

The domain model's job is to know that we're out of stock, but the
responsibility of sending an alert belongs elsewhere. We should be able to turn
this feature on or off, or to switch to SMS notifications instead, without
needing to change the rules of our domain model.


==== ... Or the Service Layer!

The requirement "Try to allocate some stock, and send an email if it fails" is
an example of workflow orchestration: it's a set of steps that the system has
to follow to achieve a goal.

We've written a service layer to manage orchestration for us, but even here
the feature feels out of place:

[[email_in_services]]
.And in the services layer it's out of place (src/allocation/service_layer/services.py)
====
[source,python]
[role="non-head"]
----
def allocate(
        orderid: str, sku: str, qty: int,
        uow: unit_of_work.AbstractUnitOfWork
) -> str:
    line = OrderLine(orderid, sku, qty)
    with uow:
        product = uow.products.get(sku=line.sku)
        if product is None:
            raise InvalidSku(f'Invalid sku {line.sku}')
        try:
            batchref = product.allocate(line)
            uow.commit()
            return batchref
        except model.OutOfStock:
            email.send_mail('stock@made.com', f'Out of stock for {line.sku}')
            raise
----
====

Catching an exception and re-raising it?  I mean, it could be worse, but it's
definitely making us unhappy. Why is it so hard to find a suitable home for
this code?

=== Single Responsibility Principle

Really this is a violation of the __single responsibility principle__footnote:[
the S from https://scotch.io/bar-talk/s-o-l-i-d-the-first-five-principles-of-object-oriented-design[SOLID]].
Our use case is allocation. Our endpoint, service function, and domain methods
are all called `allocate`, not `allocate_and_send_mail_if_out_of_stock`.

TIP: Rule of thumb: if you can't describe what your function does without using
    words like "then" or "and," you might be violating the SRP.

One formulation of the SRP is that each class should only have a single reason
to change. When we switch from email to SMS, we shouldn't have to update our
"allocate" function, because that's clearly a separate responsibility.

To solve the problem, we're going to split the orchestrationfootnote:[
Our tech reviewer Ed likes to say that the move from imperative to event-based
flow control changes what used to be _orchestration_ into _choreography_.]
into separate steps, so that the different concerns don't get tangled up. The
domain model's job is to know that we're out of stock, but the responsibility
of sending an alert belongs elsewhere. We should be able to turn this feature
on or off, or to switch to SMS notifications instead, without needing to change
the rules of our domain model.

We'd also like to keep the service layer free of implementation details. We
want to apply the Dependency Inversion Principle to notifications, so that our
service layer depends on an abstraction, in the same way as we avoid depending
on the database by using a UnitOfWork.


=== All Aboard the Message Bus!

The patterns we're going to introduce here are _Domain Events_ and the _Message Bus_.
There's a few different ways you can implement them, so we'll show a couple of different
ones before settling on the one we most like.


==== The Model Records Events

First, rather than being concerned about emails, our model will be in charge of
recording "events"--facts about things that have happened. We'll use a Message
Bus to respond to events, and invoke some new operation.

==== Events Are Simple Dataclasses

An Event is a kind of _value object_. They don't have any behavior, because
they're pure data structures. We always name events in the language of the
domain, and we think of them as part of our domain model.

We could store them in _model.py_, but we may as well keep them in their own file.
(this might be a good time to consider refactoring out a directory called
"domain," so we have _domain/model.py_ and _domain/events.py_).

[[events_dot_py]]
.Event classes (src/allocation/domain/events.py)
====
[source,python]
----
from dataclasses import dataclass

class Event:  #<1>
    pass

@dataclass
class OutOfStock(Event):  #<2>
    sku: str
----
====


<1> Once we have a number of events we'll find it useful to have a parent
    class that can store common attributes.  It's also useful for type
    hints in our message bus, as we'll see shortly.

<2> `dataclasses` are great for domain events too.



==== The Model Raises Events


When our domain model records a fact that happened, we say it "raises" an event.

Here's what it will look like from the outside: if we ask `Product` to allocate
but it can't, it should _raise_ an event:


[[test_raising_event]]
.Test Our Aggregate Raises Events (tests/unit/test_product.py)
====
[source,python]
----
def test_records_out_of_stock_event_if_cannot_allocate():
    batch = Batch('batch1', 'SMALL-FORK', 10, eta=today)
    product = Product(sku="SMALL-FORK", batches=[batch])
    product.allocate(OrderLine('order1', 'SMALL-FORK', 10))

    allocation = product.allocate(OrderLine('order2', 'SMALL-FORK', 1))
    assert product.events[-1] == events.OutOfStock(sku="SMALL-FORK")  #<1>
    assert allocation is None
----
====

<1> Our Aggregate will expose a new attribute called  `.events` which will contain
    a list of facts about what has happened, in the form of `Event` objects.

Here's what it looks like on the inside:


[[domain_event]]
.The model raises a domain event (src/allocation/domain/model.py)
====
[source,python]
[role="non-head"]
----
class Product:

    def __init__(self, sku: str, batches: List[Batch], version_number: int = 0):
        self.sku = sku
        self.batches = batches
        self.version_number = version_number
        self.events = []  # type: List[events.Event]  #<1>

    def allocate(self, line: OrderLine) -> str:
        try:
            #...
        except StopIteration:
            self.events.append(events.OutOfStock(line.sku))  #<2>
            # raise OutOfStock(f'Out of stock for sku {line.sku}')  #<3>
            return None
----
====

<1> Here's our new `.events` attribute in use.

<2> Rather than invoking some email-sending code directly, we record those
    events at the place they occur, using only the language of the domain.

<3> We're also going to stop raising an exception for the out-of-stock
    case.  The event will do the job the exception was doing.



NOTE: We're actually addressing a code smell we had until now, which is that we were
    https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/189222/are-exceptions-as-control-flow-considered-a-serious-antipattern-if-so-why[using
    exceptions for control flow]. In general, if you're implementing domain
    events, don't raise exceptions to describe the same domain concept.
    As we'll see later when we handle events in the Unit of Work, it's
    confusing to have to reason about events and exceptions together.



==== The Message Bus Maps Events to Handlers

A message bus basically says "when I see this event, I should invoke the following
handler function". In other words, it's a simple publish-subscribe system.
Handlers are _subscribed_ to receive events, which we publish to the bus. It
sounds harder than it is, and we usually implement it with a dict:

[[messagebus]]
.Simple message bus (src/allocation/service_layer/messagebus.py)
====
[source,python]
----
def handle(event: events.Event):
    for handler in HANDLERS[type(event)]:
        handler(event)


def send_out_of_stock_notification(event: events.OutOfStock):
    email.send_mail(
        'stock@made.com',
        f'Out of stock for {event.sku}',
    )


HANDLERS = {
    events.OutOfStock: [send_out_of_stock_notification],

}  # type: Dict[Type[events.Event], List[Callable]]
----
====

NOTE: Note that the messagebus as implemented doesn't give us concurrency since  
    only one handler will run at a time.
    Our objective isn't to support parallel threads, but to separate
    tasks conceptually, and keep each unit of work as small as possible.
    This helps us to understand the code base because the "recipe" for how to
    run each use-case is written in a single place.
    See <<celery_sidebar>>.

[[celery_sidebar]]
.Is this like Celery?
*******************************************************************************
Celery is a popular tool in the Python world for deferring self-contained
chunks of work to an asynchronous task queue. The messagebus we're
presenting here is very different, so the short answer is no; our messagebus
has more in common with a node.js app, a UI event loop, or an actor framework.

If you do have a requirement for moving work off the main thread, you
can still use our event-based metaphors, but we would suggest you
use _external events_ for that.  There's more discussion in
<<chapter_11_external_events_tradeoffs>>, but essentially, if you
implement a way of persisting events to a centralized store, then you
can subscribe other containers or other microservices to them. Then
you can extend the same concept of using events to separate responsibilities
across units of work within a single process / service, to being across
multiple processes--which may be different containers within the same
service, or totally different microservices.

If you follow us in this approach, then your API for distributing tasks
is your event classes--or a JSON representation of them.  This allows
you a lot of flexibility in who you distribute tasks to, they need not
necessarily be Python services. Celery's API for distributing tasks is
essentially "function name plus arguments", which is more restrictive,
and Python-only.

*******************************************************************************


=== Option 1 : The Service Layer Takes Events from the Model and Puts them on the Message Bus

Our domain model raises events, and our message bus will call the right
handlers whenever an event happens. Now all we need is to connect the two. We
need something to catch events from the model and pass them to the message
bus--the "publishing" step.

The simplest way to do this is by adding some code into our service layer.

[[service_talks_to_messagebus]]
.The service layer with an explicit message bus (src/allocation/service_layer/services.py)
====
[source,python]
[role="non-head"]
----
from . import messagebus
...

def allocate(
        orderid: str, sku: str, qty: int,
        uow: unit_of_work.AbstractUnitOfWork
) -> str:
    line = OrderLine(orderid, sku, qty)
    with uow:
        product = uow.products.get(sku=line.sku)
        if product is None:
            raise InvalidSku(f'Invalid sku {line.sku}')
        try:  #<1>
            batchref = product.allocate(line)
            uow.commit()
            return batchref
        finally:  #<1>
            messagebus.handle(product.events)  #<2>
----
====

<1> We keep the `try/finally` from our ugly earlier implementation (we haven't
    got rid of _all_ exceptions yet, just `OutOfStock`).

<2> But now instead of depending directly on some email infrastructure,
    the service layer is just in charge of passing events from the model
    up to the message bus.

That already avoids some of the ugliness that we had in our naive
implementation, and we have several systems that work like this, in which the
service layer explicitly collects events from aggregates, and passes them to
the messagebus.


=== Option 2: The Service Layer Raises Its Own Events

Another variant on this which we've used is that you can have the service layer
in charge of creating and raising events directly, rather than having them
raised by the domain model.


[[service_layer_raises_events]]
.Service layer calls messagebus.handle directly (src/allocation/service_layer/services.py)
====
[source,python]
[role="skip"]
----
def allocate(
        orderid: str, sku: str, qty: int,
        uow: unit_of_work.AbstractUnitOfWork
) -> str:
    line = OrderLine(orderid, sku, qty)
    with uow:
        product = uow.products.get(sku=line.sku)
        if product is None:
            raise InvalidSku(f'Invalid sku {line.sku}')
        batchref = product.allocate(line)
        uow.commit()

        if batchref is None:
            messagebus.handle(events.OutOfStock(line.sku))
        return batchref
----
====

Again, we have applications in production that implement the pattern in this
way.  What works for you will depend on the particular trade-offs you face, but
we'd like to show you what we think is the most elegant solution, in which we
put the unit of work in charge of collecting and raising events.


=== Option 3: The Unit of Work Can Publish Events to the Message Bus

The UoW already has a `try/finally`, and it knows about all the aggregates
currently in play because it provides access to the Repository.  So it's
a good place to spot events and pass them to the message bus:


[[uow_with_messagebus]]
.The UoW meets the message bus (src/allocation/service_layer/unit_of_work.py)
====
[source,python]
----
class AbstractUnitOfWork(abc.ABC):
    ...

    def commit(self):
        self._commit()  #<1>
        self.publish_events()  #<2>

    def publish_events(self):  #<2>
        for product in self.products.seen:  #<3>
            while product.events:
                event = product.events.pop(0)
                messagebus.handle(event)

    @abc.abstractmethod
    def _commit(self):
        raise NotImplementedError

...

class SqlAlchemyUnitOfWork(AbstractUnitOfWork):
    ...

    def _commit(self):  #<1>
        self.session.commit()
----
====

// TODO (hynek) this is super gross API design and makes me super of angry
// and I'm personally offended.  Also, sentences end with a period.

<1> We'll change our commit method to require a private `._commit()`
    method from subclasses.

<2> After committing, we run through all the objects that our
    repository has seen and pass their events to the message bus.

<3> That relies on the repository keeping track of aggregates that have been loaded
    using a new attribute, `.seen`, as we'll see in the next listing.

NOTE: Are you wondering about error-handling, what happens if one of the
    handlers fails?  We'll discuss that in detail in <<chapter_10_commands>>.


//TODO: can we get rid of _commit()?

class SqlAlchemyRepository(AbstractRepository):

    def __init__(self, session):
        super().__init__()
        self.session = session

    def _add(self, product):  #<2>
        self.session.add(product)

    def _get(self, sku):  #<3>
        return self.session.query(model.Product).filter_by(sku=sku).first()
----
====

// TODO (hynek) now I see what you meant in your email about adding functionality
// to the base class and yeah it's gross ;) In both cases you do something in the base
// and then something else additionally.  this IMHO should be a wrapper and not a
// base class
// (EJ3) I think this pattern (._foo, .foo) is ideologically sound, but looks really gross
//       if you do have never attended the Church of Enterprise Java.  Either wrapper
//       or override + extend could be other options but it would probably create cascading
//       changes.

<1> For the UoW to be able to publish new events, it needs to be able to ask
    the repository for which `Product` objects have been used during this session.
    We use a `set` called `.seen` to store them.  That means our implementations
    need to call +++<code>super().__init__()</code>+++.

<2> The parent `add()` method adds things to `.seen`, and now requires subclasses
    to implement `._add()`

<3> Similarly, `.get()` delegates to a `._get()` function, to be implemented by
    subclasses, in order to capture objects seen.

Once the UoW and repository collaborate in this way to automatically keep
track of live objects and process their events, the service layer can now be
totally free of event-handling concerns:



[[services_clean]]
.Service layer is clean again (src/allocation/service_layer/services.py)

        orderid: str, sku: str, qty: int,

    with uow:
        product = uow.products.get(sku=line.sku)
        if product is None:
            raise InvalidSku(f'Invalid sku {line.sku}')
        batchref = product.allocate(line)
        uow.commit()
        return batchref
----
====


We do also have to remember to change the fakes in the service layer and make them
call `super()` in the right places, and implement underscorey methods, but the
changes are minimal:


[[services_tests_ugly_fake_messagebus]]
.Service-layer fakes need tweaking. (tests/unit/test_services.py)
====
[source,python]
----
class FakeRepository(repository.AbstractRepository):

    def __init__(self, products):
        super().__init__()
        self._products = set(products)

    def _add(self, product):
        self._products.add(product)

    def _get(self, sku):
        return next((p for p in self._products if p.sku == sku), None)

...

class FakeUnitOfWork(unit_of_work.AbstractUnitOfWork):
    ...

    def _commit(self):
        self.committed = True

----
====

You may be starting to worry that maintaining these fakes is going to be a
maintenance burden.  There's no doubt that it is work, but in our experience
it's not a lot of work.  Once your project is up and running, the interface for
your repository and UoW abstractions really don't change much.  And if you're
using ABC's, they'll help remind you when things get out of sync.

Are you finding all those `_add()` and `_commit()` methods "super-gross", in
the words of our beloved tech reviewer Hynek?  Does it "make you want to beat
Harry around the head with a plushie snake?" Hey, our code listings are
only meant to be examples, not the perfect solution!  Why not go see if you
can do better?

One _composition over inheritance_ way to go would be to implement a
wrapper class:

    def add(self, product: model.Product):  #<1>

<1> By wrapping the repository, we can call the actual `.add()`
    and `.get()` methods, avoiding weird underscore methods.

See if you can apply a similar pattern to our Unit of Work class, in
order to get rid of those Java-ey `_commit()` methods too?

switching all the ABCs to `typing.Protocol` is a good way to force yourself
to avoid using inheritance.  Let us know if you come up with something nice!

******************************************************************************

=== Wrap-Up

Domain events give us a way to handle workflows in our system. We often find,
listening to our domain experts, that they express requirements in a causal or
temporal way, for example "When we try to allocate stock, but there's none
available, then we should send an email to the buying team".

The magic words "When X then Y" often tell us about an event that we can make
concrete in our system. Treating events as first-class things in our model helps
us to make our code more testable and observable, and helps to isolate concerns.

Events are useful for more than just sending emails, though. In Chapter 5 we
spent a lot of time convincing you that you should define aggregates, or
boundaries where we guarantee consistency. People often ask "what
should I do if I need to change multiple aggregates as part of a request?" Now
we have the tools we need to answer the question.

If we have two things that can be transactionally isolated (eg. an Order and a
Product) then we can make them *eventually consistent* by using events. When an
Order is cancelled, then we should find the products that were allocated to it,
and remove the allocations.

In Chapter 8, we'll look at this idea in more detail as we build a more complex
workflow with our new message bus.


.Recap: Domain Events and the Message Bus
*****************************************************************
Events can help with the Single Responsibility Principle::
    Code gets tangled up when we mix multiple concerns in one place. Events can
    help us to keep things tidy by separating primary use-cases from secondary
    ones.
    We also use events for communicating between aggregates so that we don't
    need to run long-running transactions that lock against multiple tables.

A Message Bus routes messages to handlers::
    You can think of a message bus as a dict that maps from events to their
    consumers. It doesn't "know" anything about the meaning of events, it's just
    a piece of dumb infrastructure for getting messages around the system.

Option 1: Service Layer raises events and passes them to Message Bus::
    The simplest way to start using events in your system is to raise them from
    handlers, by calling `bus.handle(some_new_event)` after you commit your
    unit of work.

Option 2: Domain Model raises events, Service Layer passes them to Message Bus::
    The logic about when to raise an event really should live with the model, so
    we can improve our system's design and testability by raising events from
    the domain model. It's easy for our handlers to collect events off the model
    objects after `commit` and pass them to the bus.

Option 3: Unit of Work collects events from Aggregates and passes them to Message Bus::
    Adding `bus.handle(aggregate.events)` to every handler is annoying, so we
    can tidy up by making our unit of work responsible for raising events that
    were raised by loaded objects.
    This is the most complex design and might rely on ORM magic, but it's clean
    and easy to use once it's set up.

.Domain Events: The Trade-Offs
|===
|Pros|Cons
a|
* A message bus gives us a nice way to separate responsibilities when we have
  to take multiple actions in response to a request.

* Event Handlers are nicely decoupled from the "core" application logic,
  making it easy to change their implementation later.

* Domain events are a great way to model the real world, and we can use them
  as part of the business language we use when modeling with stakeholders.

a|

* The Message Bus is an additional thing to wrap your head around; the implementation
  in which unit of work raises events for us which is _neat_ but also magic. It's not
  obvious when we call 'commit' that we're also going to go and send emails to
  people.

* What's more, that hidden event-handling code executes _synchronously_,
  meaning your service-layer function
  doesn't finish until all the handlers for any events are finished.  That
  could potentially cause unexpected performance problems in your web endpoints
  (adding asynchronous processing is possible but makes things even *more* confusing.)

* More generally, event-driven workflows can be confusing because once things
  are split across a chain of multiple handlers, there is no single place
  in the system where you can understand how a request will be fulfilled.

* You also open yourself up to the possibility of circular dependencies between your
  event handlers, and infinite loops.
