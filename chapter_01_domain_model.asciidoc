== Domain Modelling

In the <<prologue>>, we used the term _business logic layer_ to describe the
central layer of a three-layered architecture. For the rest of the book, we're
going to use the term _domain model_ instead. This is a term from the DDD
community that does a better job of capturing our intended meaning (see the
next sidebar for more on DDD).


=== What Is A Domain Model?

The _domain_ is a fancy way of saying _the problem you're trying to solve._ We
currently work for an online retailer of furniture. Depending on which system
I'm talking about, the domain might be purchasing and procurement, or product
design, or logistics and delivery. Most programmers spend their days trying to
improve or automate business processes; the domain is the set of activities
that those processes support.

A model is a map of a process or phenomenon that captures some useful property.
Humans are exceptionally good at producing models of things in their heads. For
example, when someone throws a ball toward you, you're able to predict its
movement almost unconsciously, because you have a model of how objects move in
space. Your model isn't perfect by any means. Humans have terrible intuitions
about how objects behave at near-light speeds or in a vacuum because our model
was never designed to cover those cases. That doesn't mean the model is wrong,
but it does mean that some predictions fall outside of its domain.


.This is not a DDD book.  You should read a DDD book.
*****************************************************************

Domain-Driven Design, or DDD, is where the concept of domain modelling was
popularized,footnote:[
DDD did not originate domain modelling. Eric Evans refers to _Object Design_
from Rebecca Whirfs-Brock and Alan McKean, which introduced Responsibility-Driven
Design of which DDD is a special case, dealing with the domain. But even that is
too late, and OO-enthusiasts will tell you to look further back to Ivar
Jacobson and Grady Booch; the term has been around since the mid-1980s.]
and it's been a hugely successful movement in transforming the way people
design software by focusing on the core business domain.  Many of the
architecture patterns that we cover in this book, like Entity, Aggregate
and Value Objects (see <<chapter_04_uow>>), and _repository pattern_ (in
<<chapter_02,the next chapter>>) all come from the DDD tradition.

In a nutshell, DDD says that the most important thing about software is that it
provides a useful model of some problem.  If we get that model right, then our
software delivers value and makes new things possible.

If we get it wrong, it becomes an obstacle to be worked around.  In this book
we can show the basics of building a domain model, and building an architecture
around it that leaves the model as free as possible from external constraints,
so that it's easy to evolve and change.

But there's a lot more to DDD, and the processes, tools and techniques for
developing a domain model.  We hope to give you a taste for it though,
and cannot encourage you enough to go on and read a proper DDD book.

*****************************************************************

The domain model is the mental map that business owners have of their
businesses. All business people have these mental maps, they're how humans think
about complex processes.

You can tell when they're navigating these maps because they use business speak.
Jargon arises naturally between people who are collaborating on complex systems.

Imagine that you, our unfortunate reader, were suddenly transported light years
away from Earth aboard an alien spaceship with your friends and family and had
to figure out, from first principles, how to navigate home.

In your first few days, you might just push buttons randomly, but soon you'd
learn which buttons did what, so that you could give one another instructions.
"Press the red button near the flashing doo-hickey and then throw that big
lever over by the radar gizmo," you might say.

Within a couple of weeks, you'd become more precise as you adopted words to
describe the ship's functions: "increase oxygen levels in cargo bay three"
or "turn on the little thrusters." After a few months you'd have adopted
language for entire complex processes: "Start landing sequence," or "prepare
for warp." This process would happen quite naturally, without any formal effort
to build a shared glossary.

So it is in the mundane world of business. The terminology used by business
stakeholders represents a distilled understanding of the domain model, where
complex ideas and processes are boiled down to a single word or phrase.

When we hear our business stakeholders using unfamiliar words, or using terms
in a specific way, we should listen to understand the deeper meaning and encode
their hard-won experience into our software.

We're going to use a real-world domain model throughout this book, specifically
a model from our current employment. Made.com is a successful furniture
retailer. We source our furniture from manufacturers all over the world and
sell it across Europe.

When you buy a sofa or a coffee table, we have to figure out how best
to get your goods from Poland or China or Vietnam, and into your living room.


At a high level, we have separate systems that are responsible for buying
stock, selling stock to customers, and shipping goods to customers. There's a
system in the middle that needs to coordinate the process by allocating stock
to a customer's orders.

For the purposes of this book, we're imagining a situation where the business
decides to implement an exciting new way of allocating stock.  Until now, the
business has been presenting stock and lead times based on what is physically
available in the warehouse.  If and when the warehouse runs out, a product is
listed as "out of stock" until the next shipment arrives from the manufacturer.

The innovation is: if we have a system that can keep track of all our shipments
and when they're due to arrive, then we can treat the goods on those ships as
real stock, and part of our inventory, just with slightly longer lead times.
Fewer goods will appear to be out of stock, we'll sell more, and the business
can save money by keeping lower inventory in the domestic warehouse.

But allocating orders is no longer a trivial matter of decrementing a single
quantity in the warehouse system.  We need a more complex allocation mechanism.
Time for some domain modelling.

=== Exploring The Domain Language

Understanding the domain model takes time, and patience, and post-it notes. We
have an initial conversation with our business experts and we agree on a glossary
and some rules for the first minimal version of the domain model. Wherever
possible, we ask for concrete examples to illustrate each rule.

We make sure to express those rules in the business jargon (the _"ubiquitous
language"_ in DDD terminology). We choose memorable identifiers for our objects
so that the examples are easier to talk about.

Here are some notes we might have taken while having a conversation with our
domain experts about allocation.

* A _product_ is identified by a _sku_, pronounced "skew," which is short for
  "Stock Keeping Unit."

* _Customers_ place _orders_. An order is identified by an _order reference_,
  and comprises multiple _order lines_, where each line has a _sku_, and a
  _quantity_.
+
.Example:
** 10 units of RED-CHAIR
** 1 unit of TASTELESS-LAMP

* The purchasing department orders small _batches_ of stock. A _batch_ of stock
  has a unique id which they call a _reference_, a _sku_ and a _quantity_.

* We need to _allocate_ _order lines_ to _batches_. When we've allocated an
  order line to a batch, we will send stock from that specific batch to the
  customer's delivery address.

* When I allocate 1 unit of stock to a batch, the _available quantity_ is
  reduced.
+
.Example:
** I have a batch of 20 SMALL-TABLE, and I allocate an order line for 2
   SMALL-TABLE.
** The batch should have 18 SMALL-TABLE remaining.
//TODO: CC asked us to change the "Is" to "we"s our "you"s here.

* I can't allocate to a batch if the available quantity is less than the
  quantity of the order line.
+
.Example:
** I have a batch of 1 BLUE-CUSHION, and an order line for 2
   BLUE-CUSHION.
** I should not be able to allocate the line to the batch.

* I can't allocate the same line twice.
+
.Example:
** I have a batch of 10 BLUE-VASE, and I allocate an order line for 2
   BLUE-VASE.
** If I allocate the order line again to the same batch, the batch
   should still have an available quantity of 8.

* Batches have an _ETA_ if they are currently shipping, or they may be in
  _Warehouse stock_.

* We allocate to warehouse stock in preference to shipment batches

* We allocate to shipment batches in order of which has the earliest ETA.


.Exercise for the Reader
******************************************************************************
Why not have a go at solving this problem yourself?  Write a few unit tests and
see if you can capture the essence of these business rules in some nice, clean
code.

We've got some placeholder unit tests here, but you could just start from
scratch, or combine/rewrite these however you like:

******************************************************************************


=== Unit Testing Domain Models

We're not going to show you how TDD works in this book, but we want to show you
how we would construct a model from this business conversation.

Here's what one of our first tests might look like:

[[first_test]]
.A first test for allocation (test_batches.py)
====
[source,python]
----
def test_allocating_to_a_batch_reduces_the_available_quantity():
    batch = Batch("batch-001", "SMALL-TABLE", qty=20, eta=date.today())
    line = OrderLine('order-ref', "SMALL-TABLE", 2)

    batch.allocate(line)

    assert batch.available_quantity == 18
----
====


The name of our unit test describes the behaviour that we want to see from the
system, and the names of the classes and variables that I use are taken from the
business jargon. We could show this code to our non-technical co-workers, and
they would agree that this correctly describes the behaviour of the system.

And here is a domain model that meets our requirements:

[[domain_model_1]]
.First cut of a domain model for batches (model.py)
====
[source,python]
[role="non-head"]
----
@dataclass(frozen=True)  #<1>
class OrderLine:
    orderid: str
    sku: str
    qty: int


class Batch:
    def __init__(
        self, ref: str, sku: str, qty: int, eta: Optional[date]  #<2>
    ):
        self.reference = ref
        self.sku = sku
        self.eta = eta
        self.available_quantity = qty

    def allocate(self, line: OrderLine):
        self.available_quantity -= line.qty
----
====


<1> `OrderLine` is an immutable dataclassfootnote:[In previous Python versions we
    might have used a namedtuple.  You could also check out Hynek Schlawack's
    excellent https://pypi.org/project/attrs/[attrs].]
    with no behaviour.

<2> Type hints are still a matter of controversy in the Python world. For
    domain models, they can sometimes help to clarify or document what the
    expected arguments are, and people with IDEs are often grateful for them.
    You may decide the price paid in terms of readability is too high.


Our implementation here is trivial: a `Batch` just wraps an integer
`available_quantity` and we decrement that value on allocation. We've written
quite a lot of code just to subtract one number from another, but we think that
modelling our domain precisely will pay off.

Let's write some new failing tests:


[[test_can_allocate]]
.Testing logic for what we can allocate (test_batches.py)
====
[source,python]
----
def make_batch_and_line(sku, batch_qty, line_qty):
    return (
        Batch("batch-001", sku, batch_qty, eta=date.today()),
        OrderLine("order-123", sku, line_qty)
    )


def test_can_allocate_if_available_greater_than_required():
    batch, line = make_batch_and_line("small-table", 20, 2)
    assert batch.can_allocate(line)

def test_cannot_allocate_if_available_smaller_than_required():
    batch, line = make_batch_and_line("small-table", 2, 20)
    assert batch.can_allocate(line) is False

def test_can_allocate_if_available_equal_to_required():
    batch, line = make_batch_and_line("small-table", 2, 2)
    assert batch.can_allocate(line)

def test_cannot_allocate_if_skus_do_not_match():
    batch = Batch("batch-001", 'sku1', 100, eta=None)
    line = OrderLine("order-123", 'sku2', 10)
    assert batch.can_allocate(line) is False
----
====

There's nothing too unexpected here. We've refactored our test suite so that we
don't keep repeating the same lines of code to create a batch and a line for
the same sku; and we've written four simple tests for a new method
`can_allocate`. Again, notice that the names we use mirror the language of our
domain experts, and the examples we agreed upon are directly written into code.

We can implement this straightforwardly, too, by writing the `can_allocate`
method of `Batch`.


[[can_allocate]]
.A new method in the model (model.py)
====
[source,python]
----
    def can_allocate(self, line: OrderLine) -> bool:
        return self.sku == line.sku and self.available_quantity >= line.qty
----
====

Let's skip the deallocate method because we can trivially implement it as an
increment of the `Batch.available_quantity` property, and jump to the next test:


[[test_deallocate_unallocated]]
.This test is going to require a smarter model (test_batches.py)
====
[source,python]
----
def test_can_only_deallocate_allocated_lines():
    batch, line = make_batch_and_line("small-table", 20, 2)
    batch.deallocate(line)
    assert batch.available_quantity == 20
----
====

In this test we're asserting that deallocating a line from a batch has no effect
unless the batch previously allocated the line. For this to work, our `Batch`
needs to understand which lines have been allocated. Let's look at the
implementation:


[[domain_model_complete]]
.A decent first cut of the domain model (model.py)
====
[source,python]
[role="non-head"]
----
class Batch:
    def __init__(
        self, ref: str, sku: str, qty: int, eta: Optional[date]
    ):
        self.reference = ref
        self.sku = sku
        self.eta = eta
        self._purchased_quantity = qty
        self._allocations = set()  # type: Set[OrderLine]

    def allocate(self, line: OrderLine):
        if self.can_allocate(line):
            self._allocations.add(line)

    def deallocate(self, line: OrderLine):
        if line in self._allocations:
            self._allocations.remove(line)

    @property
    def allocated_quantity(self) -> int:
        return sum(line.qty for line in self._allocations)

    @property
    def available_quantity(self) -> int:
        return self._purchased_quantity - self.allocated_quantity

    def can_allocate(self, line: OrderLine) -> bool:
        return self.sku == line.sku and self.available_quantity >= line.qty
----
====

<<model_diagram>> shows the model in diagram form.


[[model_diagram]]
.Our Model
image::images/model_diagram.png[]

Now we're getting somewhere! A batch now keeps track of a set of allocated
OrderLine objects. When we allocate, if we have enough available quantity, we
just add to the set. Our `available_quantity` is now a calculated property:
purchased quantity - allocated quantity. Using a set here makes it simple for us
to handle the last test, because items in a set are unique.


[[last_test]]
.Last batch test!  (test_batches.py)
====
[source,python]
----
def test_allocation_is_idempotent():
    batch, line = make_batch_and_line("small-table", 20, 2)
    batch.allocate(line)
    batch.allocate(line)
    assert batch.available_quantity == 18
----
====

Perhaps you think this model is too trivial to bother with object-orientation,
but throughout this book, we're going to extend our simple domain model, and
plug it into the real world of APIs and databases and spreadsheets, and we'll
see how sticking rigidly to our principles of encapsulation and careful
layering will help us to avoid a ball of mud.



.More Types for More Type Hints
*******************************************************************************

If you really want to go to town with type hints, you could go as far as
wrapping primitive types using `typing.NewType`:

[[too_many_types]]
.Just taking it way too far, Bob.
====
[source,python]
[role="skip"]
----
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import NewType

Quantity = NewType("Quantity", int)
Sku = NewType("Sku", str)
Reference = NewType("Reference", str)
...

class Batch:
    def __init__(self, ref: Reference, sku: Sku, qty: Quantity):
        self.sku = sku
        self.reference = ref
        self.available_quantity = qty

----
====


That would allow our type checker to make sure that we don't pass a Sku where a
Reference is expected, for example.

Whether you think this is wonderful or appallingfootnote:[It is appalling.
Please, please don't do this. Harry.] is a matter of debate.

*******************************************************************************

==== Dataclasses Are Great For Value Objects

We've used the _line_ liberally in the previous code listings, but what is a
line? In the business language, an _order_ has multiple _line_ items, where
each line has a sku, and a quantity. We can imagine that a simple yaml file
containing order information might look like this:


[[yaml_order_example]]
.Order info as YAML
====
[source,yaml]
[role="skip"]
----
Order_reference: 12345
Lines:
  - sku: RED-CHAIR
    qty: 25
  - sku: BLU-CHAIR
    qty: 25
  - sku: GRN-CHAIR
    qty: 25
----
====



Notice that while an order has a _reference_ that uniquely identifies it, a
_line_ does not. (Even if we add the order reference to the `OrderLine` class,
it's not something that uniquely identifies the line itself).

Whenever we have a business concept that has some data but no identity, we
often choose to represent it using a Value Object. A Value Object is any
domain object that is uniquely identified by the data it holds; we usually
make them immutable.


[[orderline_value_object]]
.OrderLine is a Value Object.
====
[source,python]
[role="skip"]
----
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class OrderLine:
    orderid: OrderReference
    sku: ProductReference
    qty: Quantity
----
====

Introduced in Python 3.7, `Dataclasses` are a neat way to represent value objects;
if you're on Python 2, you could use `namedtuples` instead. Either technique
will give you _value equality_ which is the fancy way of saying "two lines with
the same orderid, sku and qty are equal."


[[more_value_objects]]
.More examples of Value Objects
====
[source,python]
[role="skip"]
----
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import NamedTuple
from collections import namedtuple

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Name:
    first_name: str
    surname: str

class Money(NamedTuple):
    currency: str
    value: int

Line = namedtuple('Line', ['sku', 'qty'])

def test_equality():
    assert Money('gbp', 10) == Money('gbp', 10)
    assert Name('Harry', 'Percival') != Name('Bob', 'Gregory')
    assert Line('RED-CHAIR', 5) == Line('RED-CHAIR', 5)
----
====

These Value Objects match our real-world intuitions about how their values work.
It doesn't matter _which_ $10 note we're talking about, because they all have
the same value. Likewise two names are equal if both the first and last name
match, and two lines are equivalent if they have the same customer order, product code and
quantity. We can still have complex behaviour on a Value Object, though. In
fact, it's common to support operations on values, for example mathematical
operators.

def multiplying_two_money_values_is_an_error():
    with pytest.raises(TypeError):
        tenner * fiver
----
====




==== Value Objects And Entities

An order line is uniquely identified by its orderid, sku and quantity; if we
change one of those values, we now have a new line. That's the definition of a
_Value Object_: any object that is only identified by its data, and doesn't have a
long-lived identity. What about a batch though? That _is_ identified by a
reference.

We use the term _Entity_ to describe a domain object that has long-lived
identity. On the previous page we introduced a `Name` class as a Value Object.
If we take the name "Harry Percival" and change one letter, we have the new
Name object "Barry Percival."

It should be clear that "Harry Percival" is not equal to "Barry Percival":

====
[source,python]
[role="skip"]
----
def test_name_equality():
    assert Name("Harry", "Percival") != Name("Barry", "Percival")
----
====


But what about Harry as a _person_? People do change their names, and their
marital status, and even their gender, but we continue to recognise them as the
same individual. That's because humans, unlike names, have a persistent
_identity_.


[[person_identity]]
.But a person can...
====
[source,python]
[role="skip"]
----
class Person:

    def __init__(self, name: Name):
        self.name = name


def test_barry_is_harry():
    harry = Person(Name("Harry", "Percival"))
    barry = harry

    barry.name = Name("Barry", "Percival")

    assert harry is barry and barry is harry
----
====



Entities, unlike values, have _identity equality_. We can change their values
and they are still recognisably the same thing. Batches, in our example, are
entities. We can allocate lines to a batch, or change the date that we expect
it to arrive, and it will still be the same entity.

We usually make this explicit in code by implementing equality operators on
entities:



[[equality_on_batches]]
.Implementing equality operators (model.py)
====
[source,python]
----
class Batch:
    ...

    def __eq__(self, other):
        if not isinstance(other, Batch):
            return False
        return other.reference == self.reference

    def __hash__(self):
        return hash(self.reference)
----
====

Python's `__eq__` magic method defines the behaviour of the class for the
`==` operator.

For both Entity and Value Objects it's also worth thinking through how
`__hash__` will work.  It's the magic method Python uses to control the
behaviour of objects when you add them to sets or use them as dict keys;
more info https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-hashable[in the Python docs].

For Value Objects, the hash should be based on all the value attributes.
For entities, the hash should either be `None`, or it should be based
on the attribute(s), like `.reference`, that define identity over time.

//TODO (DS) Getting hash values right for these kinds of objects is quite
//important (e.g. if you're using them in dictionaries or sets). I reckon it
//might be worth spending more time on this.
// (HP): if we get into this, it links into the hack in next chapter required
// by sqlalchemy, `@dataclass(frozen=True)` -> `dataclass(unsafe_hash=True)`



=== Not Everything Has To Be An Object: A Domain Service Function

We've made a model to represent batches, but what we actually need
to do is allocate order lines against a specific set of batches that
represent all our stock.

[quote, Eric Evans, Domain-Driven Design]
____
Sometimes, it just isn't a Thing.
____

Evans discusses the idea of Domain Servicesfootnote:[Domain services are
not the same thing as the services from the
<<chapter_03_service_layer,service layer>>, although they are
often closely related.  A Domain Service represents a business concept or
process, whereas a service-layer service represents a use case for your
application.  Often the service layer will call a domain service.]
operations that don't have a natural home in an Entity or Value Object.  A
thing that allocates an order line, given a set of batches, sounds a lot like a
function, and we can take advantage of the fact that Python is a multi-paradigm
language and just make it a function.

Let's see how we might test-drive such a function:


[[test_allocate]]
.Testing our Domain Service (test_allocate.py)
====
[source,python]
----
def test_prefers_warehouse_batches_to_shipments():
    warehouse_batch = Batch('wh-batch', 'sku1', 100, eta=None)
    shipment_batch = Batch('sh-batch', 'sku1', 100, eta=tomorrow)
    line = OrderLine('oref', 'sku1', 10)

    allocate(line, [warehouse_batch, shipment_batch])

    assert warehouse_batch.available_quantity == 90
    assert shipment_batch.available_quantity == 100


def test_prefers_earlier_batches():
    earliest = Batch('sh-batch', 'sku1', 100, eta=today)
    medium = Batch('sh-batch', 'sku1', 100, eta=tomorrow)
    latest = Batch('sh-batch', 'sku1', 100, eta=later)
    line = OrderLine('oref', 'sku1', 10)

    allocate(line, [medium, earliest, latest])

    assert earliest.available_quantity == 90
    assert medium.available_quantity == 100
    assert latest.available_quantity == 100


def test_returns_allocated_batch_id():
    warehouse_batch = Batch('wh-batch', 'sku1', 100, eta=None)
    shipment_batch = Batch('sh-batch', 'sku1', 100, eta=tomorrow)
    line = OrderLine('oref', 'sku1', 10)
    allocation = allocate(line, [warehouse_batch, shipment_batch])
    assert allocation == 'wh-batch'
----

And our service might look like this:


[[domain_service]]

def allocate(line: OrderLine, batches: List[Batch]) -> str:

    )
    batch.allocate(line)
    return batch.reference
----
====


==== Python's Magic Methods Let Us Use Our Models With Idomatic Python

You may or may not like the use of `next()` above, but we're pretty
sure you'll agree that being able to use `sorted()` on our list of
batches is nice, idiomatic Python.

To make it work we implement `__gt__` on our domain model:

    def __gt__(self, other):

            return False
        if other.eta is None:
            return True
        return self.eta > other.eta

That's lovely.


==== Exceptions Can Express Domain Concepts Too

One final concept to cover, which is the idea that exceptions
can be used to express domain concepts too.  In our conversations
with the domain experts we've learned about the possibility that
an order cannot be allocated because we are _Out of Stock_, and
we can capture that using a _domain exception_:


[[test_out_of_stock]]
.Testing out of stock exception (test_allocate.py)
====
[source,python]
----
def test_raises_out_of_stock_exception_if_cannot_allocate():
    sku1_batch = Batch('batch1', 'sku1', 100, eta=today)
    sku2_line = OrderLine('oref', 'sku2', 10)

    with pytest.raises(OutOfStock, match='sku2'):
        allocate(sku2_line, [sku1_batch])
----

We won't bore you too much with the implementation, but the main thing
to note is that we take care in naming our exceptions in the ubiquitous
language, just like we do our Entities, Value Objects and Services.

[[out_of_stock]]
.Raising a domain exception (model.py)
====
[source,python]
----
class OutOfStock(Exception):
    pass


def allocate(line: OrderLine, batches: List[Batch]) -> str:
    try:
        batch = next(
        ...
    except StopIteration:
        raise OutOfStock(f'Out of stock for sku {line.sku}')
----

That'll probably do for now! We have a Domain Service which we can use for our
first use case.   But first we'll need a database.


.Domain modelling wrap-up
*****************************************************************
Domain modelling::
    This is the part of your code that is closest to the business,
    the most likely to change, and the place where you deliver the
    most value to the business.  Make it easy to understand and modify

Distinguish Entities from Value Objects::
    A Value Object is defined by its attributes.  It's usually best
    implemented as an immutable type.  If you change an attribute on
    a Value Object, it represents a different object.  In contrast,
    an Entity has attributes that may vary over time, and still be the
    same entity. It's important to define what _does_ uniquely identify
    an Entity (usually some sort of name or reference field).

Not everything has to be an object::
    Python is a multi-paradigm language, so let the "verbs" in your
    code be functions.  Classes called "Manager" or "Builder" or
    "Factory" are a code smell.

This is the time to apply your best OO design principles::
    revise SOLID.  has-a vs is-a.  composition over inheritance. etc etc.

You'll also want to think about consistency boundaries and Aggregates::
    But that's a topic for <<chapter_05_aggregate>>.
