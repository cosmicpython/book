== Building an Architecture to Support Domain Modeling


[quote, Cyrille Martraire, DDD EU 2017]

Most developers have never seen a domain model, only a data model.

Most developers we talk to about architecture have a nagging sense that
things could be better. They are often trying to rescue a system that has gone
wrong somehow, and are trying to put some structure back into a ball of mud.
They know that their business logic shouldn't be spread all over the place,
but they have no idea how to fix it.

We've found that many developers, when asked to design a new system, will
immediately start to build a database schema, with the object model treated
as an afterthought. This is where it all starts to go wrong. Instead, _behavior
should come first and drive our storage requirements._ After all, our customers don't care about the data model. They care about what
the system _does_; otherwise they'd just use a spreadsheet.

The first part of the book looks at how to build a rich object model
through TDD (in <<chapter_01_domain_model>>), and then we'll show how
to keep that model decoupled from technical concerns. We show how to build
persistence-ignorant code and how to create stable APIs around our domain so
that we can refactor aggressively.

To do that, we present four key design patterns:

* The <<chapter_02_repository,Repository pattern>>, an abstraction over the
  idea of persistent storage

* The <<chapter_04_service_layer,Service Layer pattern>> to clearly define where our
  use cases begin and end
  
[role="pagebreak-before"]
* The <<chapter_06_uow,Unit of Work pattern>> to provide atomic operations

* The <<chapter_07_aggregate,Aggregate pattern>> to enforce the integrity
  of our data

If you'd like a picture of where we're going, take a look at
<<part1_components_diagram>>, but don't worry if none of it makes sense
yet!  We introduce each box in the figure, one by one, throughout this part of the book.

We also take a little time out to talk about
<<chapter_03_abstractions,coupling and abstractions>>, illustrating it with a simple example that shows how and why we choose our
abstractions.

Three appendices are further explorations of the content from Part I:

* <<appendix_project_structure>> is a write-up of the infrastructure for our example
  code: how we build and run the Docker images, where we manage configuration
  info, and how we run different types of tests.

* <<appendix_csvs>> is a "proof of the pudding" kind of content, showing
  how easy it is to swap out our entire infrastructure--the Flask API, the
  ORM, and Postgresâ€”for a totally different I/O model involving a CLI and
  CSVs.

* Finally, <<appendix_django>> may be of interest if you're wondering how these
  patterns might look if using Django instead of Flask and SQLAlchemy.
