== Part 1: Building an Architecture to Support Domain Modelling

Most developers have never seen a domain model, only a data model.

Most developers that we talk to about architecture have a nagging sense that
things could be better. They're often trying to rescue a system that has gone
wrong somehow, and trying to put some structure back into a ball of mud.
They know that their business logic shouldn't be spread all over the place,
but they've no idea how to fix it.

We've found that many developers, when asked to design a new system, will
immediately start to build a database schema, with the object model treated
as an afterthought. This is where it all starts to go wrong. Instead, _behaviour
should come first, and drive our storage requirements._

After all, our customers don't care about the data model. They care about what
the system *does*, otherwise they'd just use a spreadsheet.

In this first part we'll look at how to build a rich object model through TDD
(in <<chapter_01_domain_model,Chapter 1>>), and then we'll see how to keep that
model decoupled from technical concerns. We'll see how to build
persistence-agnostic code and how to create stable APIs around our domain so
that we can refactor aggressively.

To do that, we'll look at four key design patterns:

* The <<chapter_02_repository,repository pattern>>, an abstraction over the
  idea of persistent storage

* A <<chapter_03_service_layer,service layer>> that clearly defines where our
  use-cases begin and end

* The <<chapter_04_uow,unit-of-work pattern>> to provide atomic operations

* And the <<chapter_05_aggregate,Aggregate pattern>> to enforce the integrity
  of our data.

If you'd like a picture of where we're going, take a look at <<part1_diag>>,
but don't worry if none of it makes any sense yet!  We'll introduce each
box one by one.

Several of the appendices are further explorations of the content from Part 1:

* Each pattern usually involves an abstraction. <<chapter_02B_abstractions>> takes a
  step back and uses a simple example to show how and why we choose abstractions

* <<appendix_project_structure>> is a write-up of the infrastructure for our example
  code: how we build and run the docker images, where we manage configuration
  info,  how we run different types of tests.

* <<appendix_csvs>> is a "the proof is in the pudding" kind of chapter, showing
  how easy it is to swap out our entire infrastructure -- the flask API, the
  ORM and postgres, for a totally different I/O model involving a CLI and
  CSVs.

* Finally, <<appendix_django>> may be of interest if you're wondering how these
  patterns might look if using Django, instead of Flask+SQLAlchemy
